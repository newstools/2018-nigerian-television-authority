Magu who stated this at the NYSC Orientation Lecture on Wednesday 25th April, 2018, at Iseyin, Oyo State, also appealed to the youths not to be mere spectators in the anti-graft campaign; rather, they should take ownership of the fight against corruption by becoming change agents and help mold the minds of the younger ones in the schools so that the fight against corruption, economic and financial crimes can be far reaching. He said the youths are expected to be the foot soldiers leading the mass rout of corruption, economic and financial crimes out of our land. The EFCC boss who was represented by Oghe Orugonya of the Ibadan Zonal office said, “apart from the fact that they are considered as the leaders of tomorrow, the decisions they make today are capable of making or marring the incoming generations. They must become role models and Change Agents to the younger ones coming behind them. Engage in skill acquisition training that can promote creativity and shun crimes which might bring immediate gains but inimical to decent future” he stated “There is no shortcut to wealth and fame. Acts of criminality might deliver wealth in the short run but ultimately, there will be misery and gnashing of teeth”, Magu said. Speaking further, he said the fight against economic crime, including corruption can only be achieved when all stakeholders embrace this important fight and one of such critical groups is the youths. “The future of this country belongs to the youths. The decision you make today will determine the type of society your children will live in. Please don’t waste this moment, join us and together we can make Nigeria great again” he emphasized.
