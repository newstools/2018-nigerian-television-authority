Parading the suspect at the scene of the crime, the Commissioner of Police, Ahmed Iliyasu, said the command had received a report of  a  missing person at the Divisional Headquarters in Ewekoro. The commissioner said  that the case was reported by one Adebola Saheed,  who stated that  his younger sister, Mrs Raliat Sanni, 35,  had  left home since March 21 and had  yet to return. Iliyasu said  on the strength of the report, police operatives at Ewekoro Division led by SP Oluwarotimi Jeje, the Divisional Police Officer, swung into action and embarked on  investigation. He said the pastor,  upon discreet analysis of facts,  was the last person who was seen with the missing person. “The so called Pastor  was promptly arrested and thoroughly interrogated. “In the course of interrogation, the pastor confessed to killing the victim and burying  her inside his church after removing her head and two hands for reasons only known to him and God,’’ he said. The police commissioner  said  the  suspect  named   another  accomplice who was also paraded. “This is the height of wickedness that can be meted out to a fellow human being. It will interest you to know that the victim was a  secret lover  to the pastor who eventually hacked her to death, ” he said. He said that forensic investigation into the case had commenced and the matter would eventually be charged to court. “This is another breakthrough resulting from painstaking technical intelligence investigation aimed  at wiping out crime in our society as well as bringing to justice those who are adamant in making crime  their business. “I appeal to the people to be always watchful of those they associate with and always disclose their movements to at least one person close to them no matter how confidential the movement  in order to prevent occurrence of this type of dastardly act, ” he said. Speaking to journalists, the suspect  said that he was not the one that killed the victim, alleging  that it was his  accomplice  who carried out the act  and later cut off her head and two hands. The suspect, a teacher at Methodist High School, Private, Arigbajo, said  that he was forced by the accomplice to join  his cult  group. He revealed that the victim was killed in the process of his initiation as a member of the cult group. The alleged accomplice, however,  denied having anything to do with the pastor, saying that the last time he saw him was last year.
