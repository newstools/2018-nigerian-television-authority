Government, through the President’s Malaria Initiative (PMI), has donated 2.6 million bed nets for distribution in Kebbi. According to the U.S. Embassy on Friday in Abuja, the bed nets, valued at 7.2 million dollars would be distributed in all local government areas of the state. ‘PMI is implemented by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) and the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). ”The USG also provided an additional 4.6 million dollars for logistics, including transportation and community mobilisation, a total USG contribution in Kebbi is 11.8 million dollars. ”The Kebbi State Government led the planning, coordination, and bed net event launch,” the embassy said in a statement. The embassy said the bed net distribution was a critical component of the ongoing effort to end malaria in Nigeria. According to the embassy, malaria is one of the deadly diseases in Nigeria, killing an estimated 107,000 people in 2016. ”The disease is especially prevalent during the rainy season, when the mosquito population increases. ”Sleeping under an insecticide-treated bed net every night is one of the best ways to prevent malaria. ”Bed nets put a vital barrier between people and the mosquitoes that carry malaria, most importantly during the hours from dusk to dawn,” it stated. The statement said that nightly use of insecticide treated bed nets prevented infections, which in turn prevents the spread of malaria. ”Since 2011, the U.S. Government has invested more than 490 million dollars to support the Government of Nigeria’s malaria control program. ”This includes procuring and distributing insecticide-treated bed nets, malaria diagnostic kits, and malaria medicines. ”In addition, the USG trains health workers to accurately test, diagnose, and treat malaria,” it added.
