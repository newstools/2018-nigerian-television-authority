Having initially been ruled out of the Europa League semi-final first leg with a hamstring injury, Costa recovered sufficiently to travel to London with Atletico Madrid, the Mirror newspaper has reported. And the fiery frontman’s potential involvement tonight is bad news for the Gunners as he was their worst nightmare during his time at Chelsea. He was public enemy No.1 whenever he faced Arsenal because of how he tormented and got under their defenders’ skin with his ability to spark trouble as much as his goals. Costa scored three times in six games against the Gunners, was booked twice and also the cause of red cards for Gabriel and Per Mertesacker. The Brazilian-born Spain striker also somehow dodged a red in the 2015 clash when Gabriel was sent off despite clashing with Laurent Koscielny. Asked if he included Costa to intimidate Arsenal or give his own squad a psychological boost boss Simeone said: “Knowing Diego Costa, I think all of those apply to him. “Both in England and in Spain, many teams have suffered at the hands of Diego Costa. Not just Arsenal. “He [physically] has improved. He trained hard on Tuesday and he trained on Wednesday and based on what we will see fit, he will either play from the start or from the bench. “He is just as motivated as the back-up goalkeeper, for example, as all the players. We are all very determined and motivated for this Europa League semi-final. “We know we will be up against a tough team who will cause us problems and Arsenal will demand us to be at our best.” Atletico will be Arsene Wenger’s final home European opponents after he announced he will leave Arsenal at the end of the season after 22 years in charge. Simeone spoke of his “admiration” for Wenger and his longevity. But having been linked with the Arsenal job in the past, he ruled himself out of replacing Wenger now the role is up for grabs. Simeone said: “No, I haven’t spoken with anyone at Arsenal. I love it here at Atletico NAN Suleiman idris is a graduate of Fed Univ of Tech Minna (BTECH Mathematics/Comp Science), Specialist in ICT Support Services. also proficient in use of online journalism tools & Social media management.
