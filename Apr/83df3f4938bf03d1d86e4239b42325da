Abdullbergy Ebbo, Minna: Some say no elected public office holder can dare go to Erena without been stoned. Others say Erena is a crisis axis that public office holders are afraid to go. Today, the people of Erena have proved them wrong, they’ve shown clearly that they’re loving and accommodating people. Governor Abubakar Sani Bello was not only welcomed by the people of Erena, he was celebrated. The importance of keeping in touch with your people cannot be overemphasized, he has never kept himself away from the people. He recently toured all the 25 LGs to hear from them directly their worries. <img src="http://www.nta.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/lolo-420x280.jpg" alt="" width="420" height="280" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-61332" srcset="http://www.nta.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/lolo-420x280.jpg 420w, http://www.nta.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/lolo-150x100.jpg 150w, http://www.nta.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/lolo-768x512.jpg 768w, http://www.nta.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/lolo-720x480.jpg 720w, http://www.nta.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/lolo.jpg 966w" sizes="(max-width: 420px) 100vw, 420px" /> The Governor even before interfacing with the people while on his way to Erena had directed the Hon. commissioner of works to have before his return a survey of the deadly Erena road, instruction which was immediately carried out by the Hon. Commissioner. <img src="http://www.nta.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/lolo1-420x280.jpg" alt="" width="420" height="280" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-61333" srcset="http://www.nta.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/lolo1-420x280.jpg 420w, http://www.nta.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/lolo1-150x100.jpg 150w, http://www.nta.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/lolo1-768x512.jpg 768w, http://www.nta.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/lolo1-720x480.jpg 720w, http://www.nta.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/lolo1.jpg 962w" sizes="(max-width: 420px) 100vw, 420px" /> Details of the 16.5km road will be issued soon. Same directives was given on the dilapidated Erena secondary schools. The road and the school the Governor assured the people will certainly be constructed. Small interventions that do not require budgetary provision are to be carried out immediately such as construction of motorize boreholes, completion of Erena central mosque as requested by the people. <img src="http://www.nta.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/lolo4-420x279.jpg" alt="" width="420" height="279" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-61336" srcset="http://www.nta.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/lolo4-420x279.jpg 420w, http://www.nta.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/lolo4-150x100.jpg 150w, http://www.nta.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/lolo4-768x511.jpg 768w, http://www.nta.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/lolo4-720x479.jpg 720w, http://www.nta.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/lolo4.jpg 965w" sizes="(max-width: 420px) 100vw, 420px" /> A.M Tanimu is an Online Editor with Africa's Largest TV Network.
