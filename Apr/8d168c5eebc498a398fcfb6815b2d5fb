Bolaji Abdullahi, Abuja: The All Progressives Congress (APC) wishes to make it clear that party dues are paid by all members of the party holding positions, either by election or appointment. Members of the National Assembly as well as cabinet ministers also remit a percentage of their earnings to the party. It is therefore totally false to say governors are expected to pay up with state money. The All Progressives Congress (APC) debunks the report by Premium Times and wishes to state that the story is misleading and has misrepresented our party. At the meeting of the National Working Committee (NWC) and the governors of the party held at the party secretariat on Thursday 26th April, it was pointed out that many of the governors have fallen behind in the payment of their party dues. While some of the governors have been up-to-date with the payments, a few others have not paid at all. The governors were therefore requested to pay up, especially in view of upcoming party activities. It is therefore possible that a governor that falls in the category of those who have not paid since inception could owe up to N250 million. It is grossly misleading, if not downright malicious, for Premium Times to simply apply this sum to everyone and multiply by the number of governors.
