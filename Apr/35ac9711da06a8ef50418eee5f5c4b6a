NCDC said that the National Lassa fever multi-partner multi-agency Emergency Operations Centre (EOC) continues to coordinate the response activities at all levels. The centre stated that response to the outbreak has however been de-escalated due to continued decline of cases over the past nine weeks. The World Health Organisation (WHO) has advised that the declining trend of cases be interpreted with caution as historical data shows that the high transmission period is yet to pass. WHO says the recent outbreak of Lassa fever in Nigeria is the largest outbreak ever reported in a country.
