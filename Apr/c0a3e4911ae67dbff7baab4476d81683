Mr Osita Aboloma, Director-General, SON made the remark in Minna, Niger while inaugurating a one-day workshop for dealers/marketers of electronic and allied products. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the workshop was tagged “Save the Nation, Shun Substandard Products.’’ According to Aboloma, this forum becomes imperative to enhance our knowledge on the danger of displaying substandard products for sale, which lack value for money. “Our experience throughout markets surveillance and inspections shows that good number of products put for sale in the markets has not complied with the relevant standards,’’ he said. Aboloma said that substandard products are dangerous to lives and property during use because they are not guaranteed hence they can fail without notice. The director-general who was represented by Hajiya Hawa Yusuf, Deputy Coordinator of SON in the state, said that the workshop would expose the stakeholders to the concept of quality. He said that the workshop would ensure that the stakeholders including consumers show compliance to the relevant standards as part of efforts to promote the economic well-being of residents of the state. Aboloma said that the forum would also ensure that products ranging from electric cables, television sets, LPG cylinders, mobile phones, refrigerators, compressors, fittings, lightings and air-conditioners are conforming to the requirements of relevant Nigerian Industrial Standards (NIS). Similarly, Mr Badewole Sunday, the state Coordinator of SON said that the organisation would not relent in sensitising stakeholders on the need to insist on NIS. “Our experiences through market surveillance and inspections have shown that much still remained to be learnt and applied by practitioners in this industry,’’ he said. Also, Mr Akeem Aromoye, a resource person in the organisation called for attitudinal change from both manufacturers and consumers of substandard products. “We are appealing to the manufacturers of substandard products to shun the act to help safeguarding public health and property. “The consumers should also stop patronising substandard products so that the producers of such goods will be discouraged,’’ he said. Alhaji Yusuf Mohammed, Chairman, Minna Market Traders Association said that the association would ensure that members shun substandard goods.
