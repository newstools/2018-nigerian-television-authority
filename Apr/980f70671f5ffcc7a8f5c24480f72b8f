Another member of the group, Mr Chibuzo Okereke, stated that the movement was prepared to sponsor Nigerian youths in many of the elective positions during the 2019 general elections once the bill became law. “Once the bill is accented to, then the political process will start; I know a whole lot of youths are gearing up and they are getting ready; they are just waiting for the accent,’’ he said. Mr Tony Nwolu, representing Oshodi/Isolo II Constituency in the Lagos State House of Assembly, said he sponsored the bill in order to close the gap in getting young people involved in mainstream politics. According to him, the country currently lacks that participation and much has been said about it as being unjust. “I believe that if you can vote, you should also be voted for; so far, we have come to the very last stage of that process and we are grateful to God. “Today we have come to meet the Vice President who has, away from pointing out some other areas, assured us of support and we look forward to the President’s accent to the bill,’’ he stated. The lawmaker said that the impact of young people was already being seen across the globe and that it would not be different in Nigeria. According to him, within our country we have seen a whole lot of our young people do amazing things in different endeavours. “When given the opportunity, you never really can under-estimate what very creative young mind can do. “We will not deny the fact that most responsibilities that have been given to young people, they have always performed excellently,’’ he said.
