Khuan added that the theatres and orchestras were important spaces for free expression, public debate and critical reflection in the country. The German Commission for UNESCO said on Tuesday that the Foreign Ministry had submitted the request to UNESCO’s Paris headquarters, and that a jury would decide whether to add the country’s theatres and orchestras to its lists in 2019. The body’s acknowledgement of intangible cultural heritage is a way of ensuring better protection of the sites and the awareness of their significance. Cultural products out of Germany that already made it on to UNESCO’s lists include falconry; organ craftsmanship and music; and the idea and practice of organising shared interests in co-operatives.
