Texas Chukwu, Abuja: The attention of the Nigerian Army has been drawn to insinuations and complaints in the media on the alleged phased withdrawal of troops on Internal Security Operations in some parts of the country. We wish to inform the public that itâ€™s not true. The Nigerian Army will continue to live to the expectations of Nigerians in the discharge of its constitutional duties of defending the territorial integrity of our dear nation and in aid to civil authorities. Consequently, troops on the ground will continue to intervene decisively to checkmate any form of criminality. We however, appeal for the general publics continuous understanding, support and cooperation. We also wish to specifically appeal to the state Governors and Local Government Councils Chairmen to also be responsive to the needs of the citizens through the provision of social and developmental infrastructures. This will help reduce incidences of crime and criminality in our society. The public is therefore advised to report any suspicious movements in their area to the security agency for prompt action.
