Kemi Adeosun, Abuja: My attention has been drawn to a smear campaign by an online medium, Premium Times, alleging “illegal sharing of pN10 billion from the national treasury.” The entire report is mischievous and made-up, negates the ethics of journalism, and displays a worrying lack of understanding of Appropriation, Payments and Control. It should therefore be disregarded by the public. Let me make it clear that warrants are issued in accordance with Appropriation and after due approval by the Cash Plan Committee which I chair.
