Turaki Hassan, Abuja: Speaker of the House of Representatives, Hon. Yakubu Dogara, has extolled the virtues of former President of the Senate, Senator David Mark on the occasion of his 70th birthday anniversary. The Speaker described Senator Mark as an elder statesman and patriot saying, “you are a man of many caps; former military administrator and two time president of the Senate.” “Distinguished is an attribute you have earned for yourself from the excellent way you discharged your responsibilities in all roles you found yourself.” He noted that Senator Mark is a man of many caps who have left masterstrokes in the way he superintended over matters of state, “putting national interests above personal ones when the need arose; from your days in the military to making the proverbial ‘lightening strike twice’ as the president of the Senate.” The Speaker prayed God to continue to bless the former Senate President with sound health and more wisdom to contribute his quota to the growth and development of Nigeria.
