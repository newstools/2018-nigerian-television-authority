The IMF made this disclosure in a statement on Wednesday from its Washington DC headquarters. The announcement of Morocco as the next location of the Meetings coincides with the 60th anniversary of the countryâ€™s membership of the WBG and the IMF. The Annual Meetings bring together central bankers, ministers of finance and development, private sector executives, civil society, media and academics. They discuss issues of global concern, including the world economic outlook, global financial stability, poverty eradication, inclusive economic growth and job creation, climate change, and others. The last time the Annual Meetings were held in Africa was in 1973, in Nairobi, Kenya. The Annual Meetings are usually held for two consecutive years at the WBG and IMF headquarters in Washington, D.C. and every third year in another member country. The 2018 Annual Meetings will take place in Indonesia in October, during which there will be an official signing ceremony for the 2021 Meetings in Morocco.
