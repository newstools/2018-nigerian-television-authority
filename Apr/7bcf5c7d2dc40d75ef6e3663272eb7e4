He described Bukar as humble, honest,  hardworking and a God fearing personality who placed national interest above all other considerations. “He played politics with decency, decorum and understanding; his death is a personal loss to me and the nation in general.” Abdullahi Bukar, elder brother to the deceased, thanked the president and said the family was very appreciative of the visit. The President visited the Bukar family in company of the Governor of  Katsina State, Aminu Bello Masari. Buhari is expected to depart Daura on Monday.
