The All Progressives Congress (APC) has constituted a committee to advise it on the way forward following President Muhammadu Buhari´s recent opposition to its National Working Committee’s (NWC) tenure extension. <img class="alignleft wp-image-49066" src="http://www.nta.ng/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/APC-420x378.png" alt="anti-party activities by apc members" width="260" height="234" srcset="http://www.nta.ng/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/APC-420x378.png 420w, http://www.nta.ng/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/APC-150x135.png 150w, http://www.nta.ng/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/APC-160x144.png 160w, http://www.nta.ng/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/APC.png 480w" sizes="(max-width: 260px) 100vw, 260px" /> Buhari had at the party´s National Executive Committee (NEC) meeting of March 27 in Abuja, said NWC’s tenure extension decided at NEC’s meeting on Feb. 27 was illegal and unconstitutional. The NEC had extended the tenure of the Chief John Odigie-Oyegun-led NWC and other executive committees of the party across all levels in the country by one year, starting from June. The president had explained that the decision was already causing acrimony within the party as some of its members who were not comfortable with the matter had taken it to court. Inaugurating the 10-member committee on Tuesday in Abuja, APC National Chairman, Odigie-Oyegun, said the committee’s mandate was to advise the party´s leadership on implementation of activities in the weeks ahead. ´´You have to advice us on the way we can implement our activities in the next few weeks or months that is politically advantageous to our party and at the same time, pay due deference to the niceties of the law. ´´We must observe the law and at the same time, ensure that we do things that will be advantageous to the party. ´´You have all the papers you will need to work with and you are at liberty to call for additional materials. You have the statement of the President, NEC resolution and the party´s Constitution. “I am sure you have access to the nation’s Constitution which will guide you also in the task that you are about to undertake,’’ Odigie-Oyegun said. He added that the committee had four days to complete its assignment “because of limited time frame’’, saying that the advice was crucial for the party to move forward. Accepting the task, Chairman of the committee, Gov. Simon Dalung of Plateau, assured that the committee would deliver on the mandate and pledged continued loyalty to the party´s leadership. He, however, called for prayers from the party´s leadership and members across the country for the committee to succeed in the assignment, saying that the committee would commence work immediately. Other members of the committee, which has Mr Muiz Banire as Secretary, include Mr Boss Mustapha, Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Gov. Nasir El-Rufai of Kaduna State and his Ondo State counterpart, Rotimi Akeredolu.
