The Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) on Friday in Abuja assured that there was no reason to get worried about a Supreme Court decision on the 2014 elections into its Executive Committee. <img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-26866" src="http://www.nta.ng/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/NFF-logo-420x274.jpg" alt="" width="420" height="274" srcset="http://www.nta.ng/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/NFF-logo-420x274.jpg 420w, http://www.nta.ng/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/NFF-logo-150x98.jpg 150w, http://www.nta.ng/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/NFF-logo-768x502.jpg 768w, http://www.nta.ng/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/NFF-logo-720x470.jpg 720w, http://www.nta.ng/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/NFF-logo-160x104.jpg 160w, http://www.nta.ng/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/NFF-logo.jpg 980w" sizes="(max-width: 420px) 100vw, 420px" /> The football body, on its twitter handle some moments after the court’s ruling, said the Supreme Court in Abuja did not nullify Amaju Pinnick’s election as NFF President. It said its reaction followed news to the contrary ongoing on social media. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that a football stakeholder, Chris Giwa, had been contesting the authenticity of the Pinnick-led board. While the Proprietor of Jos-based Giwa FC was elected NFF president at an NFF Congress in Abuja, Pinnick was elected at another NFF Congress in Warri on Sept. 30, 2014. Giwa took the matter to the apex court, after losing out at the Appeal Court and at the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS). NFF’s counsel, Festus Keyamo, was quoted in the tweet as saying: “Nobody should cause unnecessary panic in Nigeria’s football. That’s my case. “Supreme Court did not nullify Amaju’s election. The Supreme Court did not remove Amaju from office. “The Court only referred the case back to the Federal High Court to be tried properly, to know which of the elections held in 2014 was right. “Amaju was not a party to the case at the Supreme Court. So, the court could not have removed a party from office without joining the party and hearing from the party.’’(NAN) Innocent Korie is an ICT and Project Management Professional with very good flair in business development, and social media management.
