The Fashion Designers Association of Nigeria (FADAN) has urged the Federal Government to formulate policies that would encourage workers in the country to wear made-in-Nigeria fabrics. <img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-61055" src="http://www.nta.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/nigerian-fashions-420x266.jpg" alt="" width="420" height="266" srcset="http://www.nta.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/nigerian-fashions-420x266.jpg 420w, http://www.nta.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/nigerian-fashions-150x95.jpg 150w, http://www.nta.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/nigerian-fashions-768x487.jpg 768w, http://www.nta.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/nigerian-fashions-720x457.jpg 720w, http://www.nta.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/nigerian-fashions.jpg 900w" sizes="(max-width: 420px) 100vw, 420px" /> Mrs Funmi Ajila-Ladipo, the National President of FADAN, made the appeal in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on Wednesday in Abuja. She said that such policies should mandate workers in both the public and private sectors to wear locally made fabrics at least three times a week. Ajila-Ladipo noted that the issue of local content and promoting made-in-Nigeria products had been on the front burner for sometime, adding that the only way to achieve it is through such policy. “Such a policy will boost the local fashion industry and create employment for Nigerians like tailors and fashion designers, and they will in turn employ more people to work for them. “This is a policy that is bound to boost employment greatly because tailors will have more work and thus employing more hands because patronage will be high. “This will inevitably have a trickle-down effect on all stakeholders at the grassroots in the textile and fashion industry,’’ the FADAN president said. She such a policy would also protect the indigenous textile companies from foreign competitors, who “come with their brand of textiles to take away jobs from the locals’’. The FADAN president said that governments at all levels needed to encourage the production of made-in-Nigeria products through massive patronage, tax holidays and waiver on export. “This will encourage the development of the indigenous fashion industry and inevitably generate more revenue for the government’’.
