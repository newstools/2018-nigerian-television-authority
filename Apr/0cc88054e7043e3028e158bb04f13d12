The General Manager (GM) of the authority, Alhaji Malami Shekara, gave the advice on Wednesday in Birnin-Kebbi. He told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) that the authority would embark on the collection of refuse and evacuation of drains in the state. “As part of the measures to avert flooding we experienced during the rainy season last year, we urge residents to complement the state government’s efforts by evacuating the drains around their premises. “We will embark on the massive evacuation of drains in all the major towns and flood-prone areas to avoid the recurrence of flooding experienced in 2017,” he said. Shekara said that the authority would hire more trucks to complement its fleet to facilitate the work. The manager, however, warned residents against erecting illegal structures on the various drainage systems in the state. “We will not hesitate to deal decisively with defaulters as we have been sensitising them on the dangers of building structures on the drains,” he said.
