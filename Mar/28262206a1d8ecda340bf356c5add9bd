UNMIL said the last remaining 108 Nigerian FPU officers, the last UNMIL uniformed contingent remaining in Liberia, withdrew as part of the UN mission’s termination. The batch of 200 Nigerian peacekeepers had also withdrawn from Liberia in February as part of the termination of the mission’s mandate, scheduled on March 30, the mission said. “The Nigerian contingent has been deployed in Liberia since UNMIL was first established in 2003. Nigeria has been a main contributor of military and police to UNMIL. “The UNMIL has been a steadfast partner to Liberia for the last 15 years. “It has supported security and security sector reform, rule of law, efforts to disarm, human rights and sustainable peace. “The Mission will complete its mandate on March 30. “UNMIL was established in September 2003 with 16,475 uniformed personnel to monitor a ceasefire agreement in Liberia, following the conclusion of the Second Liberian Civil War”. An official farewell ceremony was held in February in honour of the last departing 689 uniformed personnel – 404 military and 285 police personnel – who had served with the Mission. This symbolised the end of UNMIL’s military and police operations in Liberia, more than 14 years after UNMIL was deployed in compliance with Security Council resolution 1509 (2003).
