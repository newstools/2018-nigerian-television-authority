Mr Stefano Pontesilli, the Italian Ambassador to Nigeria, announced the pledge during the High-Level Session of Presidents of the Lake Chad Basin Commission (LCBC) meeting of member states on Wednesday in Abuja. According to Pontesilli, Italy is concerned about the humanitarian crisis revolving around the Lake Chad shrinkage, and “there is the need for immediate attention’’.
