Wife of the state Governor, Dr Zainab Bagudu, made this known on Thursday at the distribution of the motorcycles in Birnin Kebbi. Bagudu said, “Distribution of the motorcycles is aimed at enhancing, monitoring and evaluating health activities in hard-to-reach areas for effective healthcare delivery in all the 21 local government areas.” She also called on people to support the move in order to move health sector to the next level of development. Bagudu added that the Medic Aid Cancer Foundation was in the forefront in bringing positive change to the sector. In his remarks, the state Commissioner for Health, Alhaji Umar Kambaza, commended the governor’s wife for her commitment and contributions to the sector. “The motorcycles will be distributed to all the 21 local government areas,” Kambaza said. He also stressed the need for people to support and contribute their quotas toward improving healthcare services, especially routine immunisation and the forthcoming yellow fever immunisation. Kambaza, however, urged the beneficiaries to use the motorcycles for the purpose it was meant to achieve.
