The goal of the 20 by 20 Design Charrette is to cut costs of minigrid delivered electricity by over 60 percent by addressing items such as system costs, demand stimulation, and enabling policy. This multibillion-dollar revenue opportunity will create sustainable energy for hundreds of millions of people and combine the power of global supply chains with local market entrepreneurs and communities. “I’m positive we have the right people in the room and they will deliver a financially viable solution that will truly be a game changer for the market and more importantly, for the people and communities who will gain access to power for the first time,” said Jules Kortenhorst, Chief Executive Officer, Rocky Mountain Institute.  “The aim of Rural Electrification Agency is to roll out 10,000 minigrids rapidly to support underserved communities in Nigeria and with the current regulatory landscape, Nigeria is the best market to do minigrids.” said Damilola Ogunbiyi, Managing Director, Nigerian Rural Electrification Agency. “  High-potential markets and specific minigrid sites in Nigeria will be used to pilot the recommendations from the charrette. The Design Charrette will conclude Friday, March 9, and the findings will be released to the public in coming weeks.  RMI’s Sustainable Energy for Economic Development (SEED) program has worked in sub-Saharan Africa since 2016.  SEED provides impartial technical, policy and financial advice on energy system development, and collaboration with government, development partners, and the private sector to ensure successful implementation of our recommendations. The Rockefeller Foundation and Virgin Unite sponsor the SEED program. Schneider Electric sponsored the Design Charrette.
