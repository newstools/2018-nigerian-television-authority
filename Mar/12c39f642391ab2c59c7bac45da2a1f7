Speaker of the House of Representatives, Rt. Hon. Yakubu Dogara presided. He said opening prayers and approved votes and proceedings for the previous sitting. Motion on Breach of Privilege Hon. Danburam Abubakar Nuhu moved a motion on breach of privilege, citing a story published on news platforms which alleged that members received $30,000 bribes to alter the Electoral Act Amendment Bill. Hon. Jerry Alagbaoso, while contributing to the motion, described the story as a “reckless publication” which concerned all legislators. “That publication said all of us, it did not say some of us; it did not say APC members or PDP members or APGA members.” He suggested that the matter should be referred to the committee on ethics and privileges. Hon. Mark Gbillah said he was quite embarrassed, upset and saddened that the National Assembly is once again being maligned. He said that legislators need to realise that there seems to be a premeditated attempt from certain quarters to always cast aspersion on the institution of the National Assembly and that the sequence being proposed in this amendment has actually been the most prevalent in the history of elections in the country. “This is a clear case of defamation and some punitive action needs to be taken. As an institution, we need to begin to bring certain institutions to justice so that it can serve as a deterrent”, he said. Hon. Abonta, however, said that the story did not state that bribes had been paid, but rather, that such a plan was in place. Majority Leader, Hon. Femi Gbajabiamila, disagreed with Hon. Abonta. He said that all it takes is to speculate about something in order to put the Legislature on the defensive. He also argued that bribery and corruption are criminal matters and thus, he does not think the House is covered under its rules to investigate such allegations. “This is an allegation coming from the fourth realm and this has indicted governors, ministers and members of the House. The committee on ethics and privileges is supposed to look into matters concerning the conduct of members, not allegations such as these.” He added that since the report alleged that legislators had been bribed without exempting anyone specifically, then members of the Committee on Ethics and Privileges had therefore also been indicted and suggested going to court instead of having the committee look into it. “This is a matter which is ripe for litigation and by the time we slap heavy penalties on those who pass off falsehood as investigative journalism, then perhaps there will be a stop to these incessant attacks. The only legal defence in a case like this is truth and we should take class action. This is fake news if ever I saw or heard one”, he said. Other members who contributed include Hon. TJ Yusuf, Hon. Aliyu Sani Madaki and Hon. Orker-Jev. The matter was referred to the Committee on Ethics and Privileges, with the Speaker adding that recommendations given by the committee would determine the next line of action.

Need for Gradual and Constant Rehabilitation of Nigerian Roads: Hon. Bolaji Yusuf Ayinla: The House: Notes that many Federal Roads in different parts of the country are dilapidated which has affected the free movement of people and goods across the country as a lot of delays and accidents occurring on the roads are attributable to the bad state of the roads; Also notes that all the bad Federal Roads in Nigeria need immediate attention of the Federal Government and the limited resources at the disposal of the Federal Government has made it impossible for all the roads to be rehabilitated at the same time; Further notes that successive governments had awarded contracts for the rehabilitation or reconstruction of long stretches of Federal Roads proposed in annual budgets but many of such contracts were not executed due to the inability of those governments to release funds on time for the projects; Convinced that if contracts are awarded yearly for the rehabilitation of specified stretches of selected Federal Roads, it would be easier for the Federal Government to release funds to execute them and ensure that more roads are rehabilitated within the four-year tenure of a particular administration; Resolves to: Urge the Federal Government to adopt a system of gradual and constant rehabilitation of Nigerian roads by awarding only contracts it has resources to execute within a fiscal year.
