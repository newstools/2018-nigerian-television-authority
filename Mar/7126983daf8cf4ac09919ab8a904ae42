The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that major sections of the road which failed several years ago, are now receiving  the much needed rehabilitation. A cross section of residents, who spoke with NAN, on Friday in Yenagoa, said the repair work was a welcome development. Chief Peniel Zegbe, Paramount Ruler, Yenegwe Community described road as a very important platform to socio-economic development. Zegbe, who said the  damaged parts of the road had caused untold hardship to users, urged the ministry and the contractor to improve on the quality of work to avoid the recurrence of damage. He pledged the community’s support in ensuring progress of work, especially in the area of peace and tranquility, calling on the youths to steer clear of disorder and support federal government’s  projects in the state. Another resident, Mr Austin Rector, Azikoro Community Liaison Officer, also commended the repair work, as well as the speed of work on the on-going 20.9 km of Yenegwe-Kolo-Otuoke road in the state. Mr Ayama Oweigheifa, a motorist, also hailed the construction of Kolo-Otuoke road and said  the ongoing repair work on Mbiam-Yenagoa would improve its condition. NAN reports that Mr Charles Okonma, Director Highway, Federal Ministry of Power, Works and Housing, had on Thursday carried out an inspection tour of the Yenegwe-Kolo-Otuoke road project and emergency repair on Mbiama-Yenagoa road.
