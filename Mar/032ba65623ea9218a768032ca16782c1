The English Premier League had planned in 2008 for a ‘39th game’, a round of fixtures to be played outside England, but this met fierce opposition from the league’s fans. Tebas, however, remains enthusiastic about the idea of playing one or two games per year outside Spain. “It’s a difficult and complicated issue because there are many things that need to be ironed out. “But we want to be the first league that plays an official game outside its usual territory,” he said at the Web Sport Congress on Friday. “We’re not talking about playing all 380 games per season abroad, it will be one per season or two at most. We are now trying to get clubs to agree to the decision.” The league’s two most successful clubs — Real Madrid and FC Barcelona — met in a Clasico friendly game last July in Miami, Florida, packing out the 65,000-seater Hard Rock Stadium. Neither team are expected to feature in any official game played outside Spain in the future though and certainly not against each other in a Clasico. La Liga’s head of global communications Joris Evers told Reuters in December that the aim was to present La Liga to a broader audience. “It is unlikely for it to be a Clasico, as one of the key priorities is to expand awareness and present La Liga as much broader than Real Madrid and FC Barcelona. “They are the biggest clubs and brands within La Liga and we want to take advantage of the Clasico to present the broader league, to talk to people about more stories and more clubs. “That’s how we want to grow the story of our competition and the spectacle of entertainment we have each weekend.”(Reuters/NAN) Suleiman idris is a graduate of Fed Univ of Tech Minna (BTECH Mathematics/Comp Science), Specialist in ICT Support Services. also proficient in use of online journalism tools & Social media management.
