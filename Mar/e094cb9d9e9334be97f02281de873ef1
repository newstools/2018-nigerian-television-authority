President Muhammadu Buhari led other top government officials of the APC to the partyâ€™s national caucus meeting. The meeting was held at the new Banquet Hall of the Presidential Villa, Abuja. Other top government officials who attended the meeting included Vice-President Yemi Osinbajo; President of the Senate, Bukola Saraki; Speaker of the House of Representatives, Yakubu Dogara, and state governors. The national chairman of the party, Chief John Odigie-Oyegun, led other national officers of the party to the meeting. A national leader of the party, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, was however conspicuously absent at the meeting. Tinubu is heading a presidential reconciliation committee set up to reconcile aggrieved party members across the country. It had earlier been speculated that he may present his interim report at the meeting.
