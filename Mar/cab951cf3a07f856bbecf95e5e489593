The UN spoke against the backdrop of the 2018 World Wildlife Day, celebrated every March 3, with the theme: “Big cats: predators under threat’’. According to the UN, the big cats are under increasing threat, mostly caused by human activities.

These charismatic creatures are universally revered for their grace and power, yet they are increasingly in danger of extinction”. Guterres said just more than a century ago, some 100,000 wild tigers roamed Asia, while fewer than 4,000 remained today. <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-59285" src="http://www.nta.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/big-cat2.jpg" alt="" width="661" height="443" srcset="http://www.nta.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/big-cat2.jpg 661w, http://www.nta.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/big-cat2-150x101.jpg 150w, http://www.nta.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/big-cat2-420x281.jpg 420w" sizes="(max-width: 661px) 100vw, 661px" /> According to him, all the big cats are collectively under threat from habitat loss, climate change, poaching, illicit trafficking, and human-wildlife conflict. “We are the cause of their decline, so we can also be their salvation. The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) include specific targets to end the poaching and illegal trafficking of protected species of wild fauna and flora. “Ultimately, the solution to saving big cats and other threatened and endangered species is conservation policy based on sound science and the rule of law,” he noted.

We must not let them succeed,” he urged.

Mohammed said conservation, restoration and sustainable use of biological diversity was “an effective anti-poverty strategy,” and emphasised the need to better maintain the natural resources on which billions of people depend, especially the world’s rural poor. “They say cats have nine lives. Our big cats are on at least number eight,” she said, observing, however, that in many cases, poverty, hunger and biodiversity loss are intrinsically connected.
