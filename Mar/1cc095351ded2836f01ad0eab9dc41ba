Rabiu Sani/Maiduguri(NAN): The Inspector General of Police, Mr Ibrahim Idris, said the abducted Dapchi schoolgirl, Leah Sharibu, will be freed today from the Boko Haram captivity. Idris spoke with newsmen when he visited the Military Command and Control Centre, Maimalari Cantonment, Maiduguri. ‘Obviously, I am aware and that is what we are just discussing. I am supposed to go to Dapchi today but because of the girl, I learnt she may be released. “It is a sort of understanding that we do not create much security situation and I move with a helicopter. By the time I fly there, they might think I break and that was why I postponed the visit to Dapchi,” he said.  Idris disclosed that he had directed the deployment of four mobile policemen and female personnel in each of the schools in the northeast to assist in providing protection for the students and teachers. He said that he embarked on the assessment tour of the northeast to appraise the situation to forestall the reoccurrence of the Dapchi incident.
