The agency gave the warning on Monday in Abuja in a statement signed by its management, saying that dangerous effects of carbide-ripened fruits include cancer and other illnesses. According to the management, consuming such fruits can also cause heart, kidney and liver failure. “NAFDAC hereby warns farmers and the general public against the dangers of using calcium carbide for ripening fruits such as banana, mango, plantain, orange and cashew,” the management said. On how to identify carbide-ripened fruits, the management said that “naturally ripened fruits usually have brown or black spots while those artificially ripened have traces of powdery substances and peel off quickly’’. <img src="http://18694-presscdn.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Unripe-fruits-at-papaya-pawpaw-tree-e1522077343773.jpg" />
