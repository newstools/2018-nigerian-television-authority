Sen. Bassey  Henshaw, also a member of the Board of Trustees (BoT) of the association, said this in Lagos on Friday. It was at the flag off of events to mark the triennial preparation and celebration of 100 years of the establishment of the association girl in Nigeria. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that suspected Book Haram insurgents had in February  invaded Dapchi, a community in Yobe and abducted about 110 female students of Government Girls Science and Technical College, Dapchi. “This abduction is one too many and it is becoming a thing of severe concern. “As a girl guides association, I want to say this is a great challenge and you all must double your  efforts and rise up to find a way of joining government in putting an end to this ugly trend. “These are girls innocently went to school to learn but now see what we are talking about here. “As girl guides, I am not quite sure how you will go about this, but something needs to be done. “You should emphasise and see how you can do something to help these girls. “Let the country know the sensitive role you play in nation building. It is sad that any time things like this occur, it isusually the women and girls that are affected the most,’’ he said. In her response, the Chief Commissioner of the association, Mrs Maria- Goretti Sule condemned the development. She also described it as sad and unfortunate, noting that it was also violence against the entire Nigerian women and girls. She added that the association  would continue to be at the forefront in the advocacy for the protection and all round development of the girl-child and young women in the country.
