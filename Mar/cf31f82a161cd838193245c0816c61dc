Yusuf, who resides at No. 28, Pero Bus Stop, Agege, Lagos, is facing a three-count charge bordering on breach of peace and assault. The Prosecutor, Sgt. Nomayo Kenrich, said the accused committed the offences on Feb. 19 at 7.45 p.m. on Balogun Road around Total Filling Station, Agege, a Lagos suburb. Kenrich said that the accused conducted himself in a manner likely to cause a breach of peace by assaulting Mr Oyetoro Oladimeji, a staff of Lagos State Traffic Management Authority, attached to Zone 6, Agege, while performing his lawful duty with a view of arresting him. “The accused, with others still at large, also assaulted Mr Oyekan Rasak of Lagos State Traffic Management Authority by dragging him down from the vehicle while performing his lawful duty,” he told the court. The offences contravened Sections 168(1) (d) and 173 of the Criminal Law of Lagos State, 2015 (Revised). The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that Section 173 prescribes three-year jail term for offender. The accused, however, pleaded not guilty. The Magistrate, Mrs E. Kubeinje, granted the accused bail in the sum of N50, 000 with two sureties in like sum. Kubeinje said that the sureties must be gainfully employed and show evidence of two years tax payment to Lagos State Government. She adjourned the case until March 21 for mention.
