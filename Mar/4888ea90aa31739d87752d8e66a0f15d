The final is slated for Saturday evening, but Okezie could not go beyond the semi-final after finishing fifth in heat 3 with a time of 48.53 seconds. The 24-year-old, with a season best 46.58 and personal best 46.48, ran from lane two but he could not reproduce his pre-competition form. He had even qualified for the semi-finals with a 46.91 to suggest a better placing in the semi-finals. In the women’s event, his compatriot Patience Okon-George had earlier in the day crashed out after failing to start the race. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the championships which got underway on Thursday will end on Sunday.(NAN) Suleiman idris is a graduate of Fed Univ of Tech Minna (BTECH Mathematics/Comp Science), Specialist in ICT Support Services. also proficient in use of online journalism tools & Social media management.
