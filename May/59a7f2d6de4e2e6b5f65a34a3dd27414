Gov Sani-Bello discussed boundary dispute between Niger state and FCT, environmental degradation, remittance of payee tax and infrastructure decay. On boundary dispute, Niger and FCT agreed to set up a joint committee to resolve the lingering boundary disputes in border towns in the area. The two leaders agreed to reactivate the joint boundary committee of the state and the territory in order to resolve the boundary disputes and determine under whose purview and control is the land in border towns of Dakuwa and Kuduru between Tafa Local Government area of Niger State and Bwari Area Council of FCT rest. Governor Sani-Bello had earlier raised concern on the tension brewing over control of land in Dakuwa and Kuduru which bothTafa Local Government area of the state and Bwari Area Council are laying claim to. The governor drew the attention of the minister to the environmental and developmental challenges in Madalla and Suleja towns in Suleja local government area of the state due to there proximity to the FCT. Governor Sani-Bello also raised concern over attendant delapidation of public infrastructure in Suleja local government due to increasing number of FCT workers who residing in Suleja and environs without correspondent support from the FCT even when the affected workers are not paying their taxes to the state. The governor however acknowledged the efforts of the minister at ensuring remittance of PAYEE tax of federal civil servants domicilling in Suleja. In his reaction, the Minister said both parties must work together and find a lasting solution to the disputed areas, he also stressed the need for the councils and members of the public to take charge of environmental challenges of their areas, especially waste management. On the non-remittance of PAYEE taxes of federal government public servants residing in Suleja and environs, the Minister said but for on-going verification of the affected personnel, his ministry was prepared to remit such taxes to the state. The two leaders then directed chairmen of the affected local councils to stop further allocation of land until when the disputed lands are peacefully resolved in order to forstall avoidable crisis and litigations. Commissioner for Finance, Alhaji Zakari Abubakar and the chairmen of Tafa and Suleja local government council, Honorable Ado Abubakar and Honourable Shuaibu Abdullahi Maje respectively were on the entourage of the governor.
