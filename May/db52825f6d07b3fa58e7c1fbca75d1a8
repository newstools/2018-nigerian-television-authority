Mrs Pat Emeordi, the corps Sector Commander in the state, made this known on Monday in Jos. According her, the initiative is aimed at inculcating safety education in children with a view to increasing their level of awareness. “The idea behind this initiative is to catch them young and to enable them understand the fundamentals and rudiments of safety education. “We are already talking with the State Universal Basic Education Board (SUBEB) and the state Ministry of Education to ensure the implementation of the initiative. “So, by the special grace of God, we shall soon start the programme in Plateau,” he said. Emeordi explained that the safety education would be infused into core subjects like English Language, Mathematics, Science and Technical Education, among others. “Government doesn’t need to employ new teachers to teach safety education, but teachers of these core subjects will be the ones to do it. “We shall train these teachers who will in turn teach the students in the schools,’’ she added. Emeordi called on the state government to support the initiative and the corps in its bid to rid the road of accidents.
