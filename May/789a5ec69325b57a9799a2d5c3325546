Protocols: I welcome you all to State House, for this farewell reception, as you prepare to depart for the FIFA 2018 World cup Finals in the Russian Federation. You are going to represent us in Russia. You must bear in mind that you are not just going for a tournament. With each game, you must remember that you are carrying the passions, emotions and feelings of over 180 million people. Play fair and clean, but demonstrate the gallant spirit which Nigerians are known for. Nothing unites Nigerians more than football and nothing will gladden the people of Nigeria than for you to acquit yourself honourably by winning in Russia. You are the youngest team in the tournament; which means you are likely the most inexperienced team, a fact that will not be lost on your opponents. But it is also something you can use to your advantage. You have the full support and the blessings of all Nigerians, who will look up to you for as long as the tournament lasts. I commend the Nigerian Football federation for drawing up the right programme that is helping to refine the Team into the power horse it is meant to be. This is our time, we look up to you to make us proud. All Nigerians join me in saying to you: BEST OF LUCK! Thank you and God be with you all.
