Guillaume de Kerdrel, First Counsellor of the French Embassy in Abuja, signed the agreement with Première Urgence Internationale (PUI) and Alima. The PUI and Alima, are both active in providing aid in the north-east region of Nigeria. Amb. Guillaume indicated that the money would be dedicated strictly to fund two projects in the region. “The 500,000 euros will cater to two specific projects. ” The first is aimed at improving medical care for children suffering from malnutrition in the newly accessible parts of Kukawa Local Government Area in Borno. ” The second is aimed at improving the food security of vulnerable populations in Maiduguri. “The French government through the French Embassy in Nigeria is expressing its commitment to contributing to humanitarian efforts that will lead to the continual rehabilitation and restoration of the north-eastern region of Nigeria which has suffered greatly from the insurgency of the terrorist group, Boko Haram.” (NAN) Hinatufe Henry Solomon is a graduate of Computer Science, specialist in ICT Support Services.
