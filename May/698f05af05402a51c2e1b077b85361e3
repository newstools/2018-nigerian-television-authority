The National Public Relations Officer of NPS, Mr Francis Enabore, disclosed this to the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in a telephone interview. NAN reports that the NPS online recruitment started on April 30 and would close on June 11, 2018. “We have a monitoring desk at our headquarters in Abuja and so far about 39, 000 applicants had reached different stages of processing their applications. “All the applications are also monitored by the Nigeria Communication Commission (NCC) and many have actually succeeded in submitting and printing out the acknowledgement slips. ” In fact, about 3,000 have completed, submitted and printed their forms online successfully,” said Enabore, a Deputy Controller of Prisons (DCP). He refuted claims that the portal was shut down. He said that some applicants without required documents were unable to access and process their documents online. The NPS spokesperson advised interested candidates to be patient, adding that the bandwidth of the recruitment portal had been expanded to cope with the large volume of applicants. “The portal is working and receiving applications throughout the federation. “If you are having difficulties in accessing the portal during the day, try during late hours or early in the morning when there is less traffic,” he said Suleiman idris is a graduate of Fed Univ of Tech Minna (BTECH Mathematics/Comp Science), Specialist in ICT Support Services. also proficient in use of online journalism tools & Social media management.
