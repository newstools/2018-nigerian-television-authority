On April 4, APGA and PDP threatened to boycott the poll over alleged non-transparency in the composition of NASIEC  by Gov.Tanko Almakura. APGA National Secretary, Mr Labaran Maku, and the state Chairman of PDP, Mr Francis Orogu, had alleged that NASIEC members were card carrying members of APC. They alleged that NASIEC would dance to the tune of their masters, adding that the commission’s chairman was a former chairman of Doma Local Government under Gov.Almakura administration. In his reaction on April 10, Mr Musa Elayo, the Chief Press Secretary to Gov.Tanko Al-Makura, urged the two parties to provide evidence to prove their allegation.
