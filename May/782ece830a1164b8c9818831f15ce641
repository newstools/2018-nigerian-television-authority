President Muhammadu Buhari yesterday was in Daura, his home town for the APC Ward Congress taking place today. While in Daura in his ward with delegates and party faithfuls, the President made it clear why he’s re-contesting and also gave reason why he reamin in the game. “I am in politics for fun, frivolity or to amass wealth, I have always been driven by a deep sense of commitment to make a difference to the lives of our people.” “After my retirement from the army, or forceful retirement, I sat back and watched as events unfolded on the political turf, and realised the country needed an intervention for fairness, justice and inclusion of Nigerians in the issues that affect their lives.” A.M Tanimu is an Online Editor with Africa's Largest TV Network.
