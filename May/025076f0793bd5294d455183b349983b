Abdullbergy Ebbo, Minna: The purchase by Niger State Government of 200 tractors which are to be given out at subsidized rates to farmers within the state is another clear pointer to Governor Abubakar Saniâ€™s commitment to sustaining runs of uncommon successes in food security and sufficiency in the state and Nigeria at large. However, the move will equally assure sustainable accomplishment as first and best state in rice production across seasons. <img src="http://www.nta.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/IMG_20180505_212805-420x280.jpg" alt="" width="420" height="280" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-62373" srcset="http://www.nta.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/IMG_20180505_212805-420x280.jpg 420w, http://www.nta.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/IMG_20180505_212805-150x100.jpg 150w, http://www.nta.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/IMG_20180505_212805-768x512.jpg 768w, http://www.nta.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/IMG_20180505_212805-720x480.jpg 720w, http://www.nta.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/IMG_20180505_212805.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 420px) 100vw, 420px" /> 200 tractors coming to Niger state at a go will enable growths in the production of other crops, a fact being admitted by local farmers themselves.
