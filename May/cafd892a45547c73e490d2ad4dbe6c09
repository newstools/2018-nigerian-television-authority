The Emir of Daura, Alhaji Umar Faruq said the project sites had been taken over by reptiles before the Buhari administration came to their rescue to complete the project. He underscored the need for any administration to take cue from Buhari’s policy of completing on-going and abandoned projects of his predecesors before embarking on new ones for continuity.
