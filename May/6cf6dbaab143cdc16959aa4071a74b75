Godwin Onyeacholem, Abuja: The Federal High Court sitting in Abuja today 24th May 2018 presided over by Hon Justice John Tsoho nullified the suspension of Hon Abdulmumin Jibrin from the House of Representatives for 180 legislative days.

It should therefore act as the bedrock of constitutional democracy. While affirming that Hon Jibrin and every other member of the House has a constitutional responsibility and in line with the code of conduct of the House to expose corruption, the court ordered the immediate payment of Hon Jibrinâ€™s salaries, allowances and other entitlements from the date of his suspension till date.
