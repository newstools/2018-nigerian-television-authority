The case was triggered by a petition from one Edna Ishaya in which she alleged that, between January and August, 2017, the convict fraudulently used a sort code of one of the new generation Banks and her mobile phone number registered with the Bank to transfer the sum of eight hundred and forty three thousand Naira only (N843, 000, 00.) to his personal use, without the petitioner’s knowledge and consent. Investigation by the Commission revealed that the amount in question was transferred to the convict’s wife account domiciled also at one of the new generation Bank. He was arraigned on April 11, 2018 and pleaded guilty to all the charge preferred against him. The case was adjourned to today for sentencing. Justice Iliya in her judgment sentenced the convict to 3 years imprisonment on each of the 2 count charge. He was however offered the option of N50, 000 fine on each count. The Judge also gave an order of restitution of Eight Hundred and Forty Three thousand Naira (N843, 000,00) to the victim of the crime.
