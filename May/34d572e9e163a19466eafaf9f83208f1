Photo credit: Kevin Mazur/One Voice Kim Kardashian West will reportedly meet with President Donald Trump at the White House on Wednesday. The meeting is part of the reality star’s ongoing effort to obtain a pardon for Alice Johnson, a 62-year-old great-grandmother who is serving a life prison sentence, according to Vanity FAIR tweeter handle @VanityFair, citing sources. Kardashian West, along with her attorney, will first meet with White House senior adviser Jared Kushner, whose own father spent more than a year in prison for tax evasion, illegal campaign contributions and witness tampering before the three sit down with the president. Johnson is serving a life sentence without parole for a first-time nonviolent drug offence, according to Mic, which did a video profile of the woman in 2017 that initially brought Kardashian West’s attention to the case. “If you think about a decision that you’ve made in your life and you get life without the possibility of parole for your first-time nonviolent offence, there’s just something so wrong with that,” Kardashian West told the outlet. Kardashian West has reportedly been working for months to grant Johnson a presidential pardon and has been in communication with Kushner and other members of the Trump administration, according to the outlet. The scheduled meeting between Kardashian West and Trump comes on the heels of two major criminal justice developments at the White House. Last week, Trump granted a posthumous pardon to Jack Johnson, boxing’s first black heavyweight champion, following pleas from actor Sylvester Stallone and Johnson’s great-great niece. After the meeting, Kushner and wife Ivanka Trump plan to host the reality star at their home for dinner, the magazine reported. (NAN) Currently in Social Media platform of NTA, Largest TV in Africa.
