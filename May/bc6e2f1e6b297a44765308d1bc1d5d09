The theme is “The role of cultural institution in the promotion of cultural diversity and inter-cultural dialogue for peaceful co-existence’’. Tsanni said, “It is very important to include cultural education in school curriculum in other for the students and young pupils to be abreast of their culture from childhood. “Culture can be used to promote diversity, intercultural dialogue and peaceful coexistence. “Nigeria, with her over three hundred tribes and countless cultural products can begin to harvest and deploy her cultural products to promote her multicultural nature, unity and peaceful coexistence,’’ he said. He advised cultural institutions in the country to promote understanding and appreciate the different diverse cultural identities and products of Nigerians within and outside the country. “These can be attained through interstate or international competitions, exhibitions, festivals, workshops, conferences and town hall meetings,” he said. Mr Dare Durosimi, the Chairman, RATTAWU, Lagos State Council, said that the public lecture was aimed at providing opportunities to deepen understanding of the values of cultural diversity. “This event is organised to call government’s attention to this sector and request that adequate funding should be made available for this institution. “So, the stakeholders in the sector can contribute effectively to the development of the nation’s economy,’’ he said.

Babawale, represented by Dr Akinwale Onipede of the Dept. of Creative Arts, University of Lagos, advised the government to always apply merits in appointing people into governance. He said, “Culture is the roadmap to any societal development, there can be no meaningful development in any society that has lost her sense of culture’’ he said. (NAN).
