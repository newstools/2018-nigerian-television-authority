Adebayo told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Abuja he was proud of his Minna-based team following the team’s 44-24 defeat of Borno Spiders for their sixth consecutive win. “My players have been listening to instructions and playing according to expectations. “We started training since January and the players’ level of fitness is very high which has seen them emerge victorious in all six matches played so far. “During my time as a player in Niger United, we won the league about seven times with Malta Guinness as our sponsor in the 1990s. “But as a coach of the team, we have won none. So, we are aiming for the league title and I am optimistic we will get it,’’ he said. The coach also lauded the efforts of the present Handball Federation of Nigeria (HFN) board led by Sam Ocheho, as well as league sponsors Prudent Energy, for reviving the game. Niger United currently lead 11 other male teams after six matches in the first phase of the 2018 Prudent Energy Handball League being played at the Abuja National Stadium. They have 12 points from six wins. NAN reports that the competition began on Friday and will end on Sunday.
