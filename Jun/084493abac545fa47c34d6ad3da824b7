Henry Edmond, 47, metal fabricator; Richard Effiong, 22, businessman; Simeon Michael, 30, self employed; and Ashumu Muhammed, 33, security guard are being tried for defilement. Magistrate Mrs B.O. Osunsanmi refused to take the plea of the accused but ordered that they should be kept behind bars pending advice from the State Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP). “Based on the sensitivity of the case, it is difficult to grant bail. Bail will be at the discretion of the court. “Case file should be documented and sent to the office of the DPP for advice,” she said.
