Adaramati told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Lagos that the competition was to promote the potential of online visual arts in the country and encourage up-and- coming artists. He said that the competition scheduled for June 20 would hold at Omenka Gallery, Ikoyi in Lagos State. NAN reports that ‘Afriuture’ is coined from the fusion of Africa and future and is aimed at shaping artists’ perceptions about an ideal African society. “The competition will feature young and vibrant artists that will be competing for the grand prize of $2, 500. “They are expected to submit entries that will depict an African Utopia from their own perspectives,” he said. Adaramati said that all entries by participating artists would be assessed by a panel of eminent and renowned art personalities. He said that they would include: Nike Okundaye, Oliver Enwonwu, Abiodun Olaku and Fred Adenekan. He said, “The African art market is still just emerging in terms of its dialogue with the contemporary international art scene. “Our main goal at RAF is to establish a strong link between the world and the contemporary art scene in Africa which will make Nigeria to become the capital of art in the world,” he said. Adaramati said that it was important to expose the art industry to innovative expansion which would serve as a harbinger of tourism, national prestige and foreign investments. “It is necessary to innovate new ways in which to expand and grow the contemporary African art industry in achieving equity and the preservation of culture. “This will help in acquiring more knowledge, designed toward the empowerment of contemporary art in Africa, in dedication and servitude to the autonomy of art globally. “We would serve as a vehicle and harbinger of arts, culture and national prestige attracting foreign investment and contributing positively to the image of Nigeria and Africa at large,” he said. NAN reports that RAF is Africa’s leading online virtual gallery, showcasing the African art scene with online web and mobile application platforms.
