According to AHRC, the Commission is not aware of any other countries where a national inquiry or similar process has been established in response to #MeToo. Minister for Women Kelly O’Dwyer told newsmen the inquiry, which will cost one million Australian dollars (738,000 dollars), is a “world first.” “We can’t find any other country that’s looking at this issue in such a comprehensive manner,’’ she added. According to O’Dwyer, the government has given all the support that we can in order to make sure that this is not only a significant inquiry for us in Australia. However, there will probably be some learnings that other countries can take from it as well. According to government data, over 20 percent of people over 15 years old in Australia have been sexually harassed with 68 percent of the harassment occurring in the workplace.
