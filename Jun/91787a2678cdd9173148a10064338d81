Oduwole made the pledge at a South-south Ease of Doing Business Reforms Forum in Benin on Monday. She said the South-south region had the potential to emancipate the country economically if the constituent states collaborated to explore other resources beyond oil. She said the Federal Government was addressing the challenges of power and other infrastructure to support Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) predominant in the region. “The region has the geographic location and resources such as gas, agrarian and millions of MSMEs and MSMEs are the engine that would stimulate Nigeria’s economy. “We know that the enterprising nature of men and women in the region are what is going to drive development in the country,” she said. Gov. Godwin Obaseki of Edo, in his opening remarks, said his administration would create a friendly environment where both domestic and foreign investors could do business favorably. He said that the Edo model was structured in such a way that local investors must grow before foreign investors so that the place of SMEs would be assured.
