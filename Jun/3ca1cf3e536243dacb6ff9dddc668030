A gunman fired through a glass door at a newspaper house in the Maryland capital of Annapolis and sprayed the newsroom with bullets on Thursday, killing at least four people and injuring several others, news reports said. The suspect has been apprehended and no motive is known for the attack at the Capital Gazette newspaper, local news reports said. Law enforcement in Baltimore and New York City deployed protective forces to major media outlets as a precaution, authorities said. For now, the Annapolis shooting is being treated as a local incident and not one that involves terrorism, a law enforcement official said. The Federal Bureau of Investigation is on the scene assisting local authorities, the official said.  Davis said a single shooter “shot multiple people at my office, some of whom are dead.” He later said he was safe and being interviewed by police. “There is nothing more terrifying than hearing multiple people get shot while you’re under your desk and then hear the gunman reload,” he tweeted. President Donald Trump has been briefed on the shooting, White House spokeswoman Lindsay Walters said. “Our thoughts and prayers are with all that are affected,” she said. Trump was aboard Air Force One, returning to Washington from an event in Wisconsin. One law enforcement source told CBS News the suspect is a male in his 20s who had no identification on him. Two law enforcement sources told CBS News the suspect used a shotgun. Police also went to the offices of the Baltimore Sun as a precaution, that paper reported. The New York Police Department said it was beefing up security at New York-based news organizations as a precaution.
