Sumonu told newsmen in Damaturu on Tuesday that Adamu, who is about 30 years old, has made a confessional statement. Sumonu said: “I am very happy to tell you that the perpetrator of the 29th May killing of Hauwa Muhammad, 24, has been apprehended and has made a confessional statement” The suspect, in an interview with newsmen attributed his action to drug abuse. “My name is Muhammed Isa Adamu from Potiskum LG. I started dating Hauwa since 2014. She was obedient to me. She never offended me. “I have been abusing drugs for almost five years. I even went to Azare General Hospital to seek medical advice in order to get rid of my addiction. “I tried as much as possible to convince my family to meet Hauwa’s over our marital arrangement but my effort became unsuccessful. “Eventually another guy started dating her. That was the beginning of our problem. She told me that if my family could not meet hers, I should allow the other guy to do so. “Apart from that, there was no problem between the two of us. “One day I didn’t know what happened to me, I took my “Exol” and decided to end the lives of both of us. I killed her  with a knife”, Adamu said. “I equally wanted to kill myself butshe stopped me from doing that. While she was bleeding, she said I should not kill myself. May her soul rest in peace. “She further advised me, before she bled to death, that I should repent and seek Allah’s forgiveness. I then promised her not to kill myself and that I will report myself to the police. “Which is why when the DPO ‘C’ division called me, I reported at once”, the suspect said. Adamu said that he was a fresh graduate from Federal College of Technical Education, Potiskum, affiliated to Federal University of Technology Minna. He advised hard drug users to quit the habit as it will only lead to the dead end that he found himself. Hauwa was said to have left home on  May 29 to buy a loaf of bread but did not return. She was later found dead on the same day.(NAN) Suleiman idris is a graduate of Fed Univ of Tech Minna (BTECH Mathematics/Comp Science), Specialist in ICT Support Services. also proficient in use of online journalism tools & Social media management.
