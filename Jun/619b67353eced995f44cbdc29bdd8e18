Mr Clement Oladele, the Ogun Sector Commander of FRSC,  made this known to the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on Sunday in Ota, saying  the exercise  would begin on  Wednesday. Oladele said that 1,000 personnel, including regular and special marshals, would be deployed across the state to  ensure an  accident-free celebration. “Our men will be in  Abeokuta, Sango-Ota, Ifo, Lagos-Ibadan Expressway, Ijebu-Ode, Sagamu to mention just a few places. “We implore those driving vehicles without number plates to desist from such act because anyone caught will face the wrath of  the law. “Those who drive against traffic and use  bad tyres will also face the full weight of the law,” Oladele said. He felicitated with Muslim faithful on the forthcoming celebration  and admonished  them to be safety conscious.  (NAN) Suleiman idris is a graduate of Fed Univ of Tech Minna (BTECH Mathematics/Comp Science), Specialist in ICT Support Services. also proficient in use of online journalism tools & Social media management.
