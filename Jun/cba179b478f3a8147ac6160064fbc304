She explained that there is a challenge of not reporting cases of child sexual abuse by families of victims for cultural or social reasons. The rep said that the foundation intends to end child sexual abuse in the country by 2030. She said every six out of 10 girls have been abused and that the foundation was out to fight child sexual abuse and ensure that victims get justice against predators.

Pius called on Nigerians to support the foundation in the fight against child sexual abuse especially in the war torn North East region. She stressed the need for all stakeholders to speak out and defend children, adding that success could only be achieved through effective synergy. Pius said that the foundation was collaborating with agencies saddled with the responsibility to address extreme poverty to ensure better life for children. She said that the collaboration was necessary as most victims were from very poor homes with little or nothing to live on. Pius said foreign experts had been invited to the workshop to join forces with local ones to do justice to the matter.
