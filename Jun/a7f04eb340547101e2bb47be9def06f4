The early payment of the salaries is to enable civil servants and their families fully enjoy the festivities of the Eid El – Fitr. All banks are therefore enjoined to ensure that workers access their salaries with ease. The gesture is also in line with Governor Ganduje ‘s pledge to improve the welfare of workers in the state. It is therefore hoped that the workers will reciprocate the good gesture by being more dedicated and hardworking in the discharge of their duties for the overall development of the state.
