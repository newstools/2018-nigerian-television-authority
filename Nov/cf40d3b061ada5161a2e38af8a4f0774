Femi Adesina: President Muhammadu Buhari congratulates the Super Eagles of Nigeria on their qualification for the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations following the score draw against the Bafana Bafana of South Africa in Johannesburg Saturday. The President joins millions of football-loving Nigerians in commending the team for their spirited and disciplined performance against a very formidable opponent which earned them qualification with the final match against Seychelles a mere formality. Having keenly followed the senior national football teamâ€™s progress in the qualifying stages, President Buhari is enthused by their confidence, sense of patriotism and professionalism, and commends these attributes to other Nigerians. He equally commends the coaching crew, the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) and the Supporters Club, especially Nigerians residing in South Africa who turned out in great numbers to cheer the players, for a job well-done, and assures them of the unflinching support of the Federal Government going forward. The President wishes the young Nigerian football ambassadors more successes as they prepare for the AFCON tournament in Cameroon.
