On November 8, 2018, the Presidential Committee on the North-East Initiative (PCNI) and the Orji Uzor Kalu Foundation, commenced a medical outreach to treat 1,000 Internally Displaced Persons suffering from Vesico Vaginal Fistula (VVF) in Maiduguri, Borno State. The Foundation’s Executive Secretary, Rev. Jemimah Kalu, who disclosed this at the launching of the two-day outreach at Bakassi IDP Camp, also said that the foundation has conducted preliminary investigations and discovered that toilet infection was common at most camps. She said that the foundation decided to intervene by distributing antibiotic drugs to the IDPs. “We found out that due to the use of public toilets by many people at the camp, toilet infection is rampant among women.” She said drugs for the treatment of chronic wounds and skin infections were also given to the IDPs by health workers mobilized by the foundation and PCNI. “Others may be bringing food, but the Kalu Foundation felt that a medical intervention would go a long way in assisting the IDPs,” she said. In his remarks, Ibrahim Machina, the PCNI representative in Borno, commended the foundation for coming to the aid of the IDPs. He appealed to other local and international foundations to emulate Orji Uzor Kalu Foundation. Tanimu is an Online Editor with Africa's Largest TV Network. Produces when not on Social media.
