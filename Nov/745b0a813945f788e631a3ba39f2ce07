Mijinyawa disclosed this on Saturday at a two-day sensitisation meeting organised for secondary health facilities desk officers in Kano. She said that the agency had engaged about 262 private and public health facilities to render quality healthcare services to the workers. The scribe explained that the meeting was organised to create better understanding of the scheme between primary and secondary health facilities. Earlier, the state Commissioner for Health, Dr Kabiru Getso, tasked the desk officers to support government’s commitment in delivering quality healthcare. “Healthcare provision is a team work as such there is need for all and sundry to participate towards improving the system from the grassroots,’’ Getso said. NAN recalls that the Ganduje administration in the state had six months ago introduced the Contributory Health Scheme to provide easy access to quality healthcare services.
