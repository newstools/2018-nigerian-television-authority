Mr Danladi Zhin, the FCT Coordinator, at the inauguration in Abuja urged the new executives to preach the message of unity and good governance of the present administration in their respective area councils. Zhin also charged the new officials to be committed to their jobs and to ensure that the good job of the administration was conveyed to the grassroots. According to him, Buhari has no money to share for the masses for his re-election but the legacy on ground would speak louder than any presidential aspirant. The new executives are Mr Ibrahim Abubakar, Coordinator for Abuja Municipal Area Council; Mr Sunday Ali, Bwari Area council, and Mr Suleiman Mohammed, Abaji Area Council. Mr Elisha Emmanuel was inaugurated as Coordinator for Kwali Area Council; Mr Bajakai Musa, Kuje Area Council, and Mr Jibrin Garba for Gwagwalada Area council. Speaking on behalf of the executives, Mr Ibrahim Abubakar, the Coordinator for Municipal Area Council, promised to ensure the re-election of Buhari by marketing the presidentâ€™s laudable achievements in various spheres of national life. <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-70462" src="http://www.nta.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/GOGAN1.jpg" alt="" width="684" height="433" srcset="http://www.nta.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/GOGAN1.jpg 684w, http://www.nta.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/GOGAN1-150x95.jpg 150w, http://www.nta.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/GOGAN1-420x266.jpg 420w" sizes="(max-width: 684px) 100vw, 684px" /> The group had earlier on Thursday launched the Buhari Unity Band to unite Nigerians and gather support for President Buhari.
