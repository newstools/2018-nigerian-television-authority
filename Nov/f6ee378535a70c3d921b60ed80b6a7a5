Mr Muminu Badmus, the Managing Director, Lagos Water Corporation, on Thursday assured residents in areas affected by ongoing repairs of water leakages at the Akute intakes of restored water supply. Badmus said via a statement in Lagos that the repair of water leakages at the Akute Intakes had adversely affected water production and supply at the major waterworks in Adiyan. “The Adiyan Waterworks is one of our largest waterworks, supplying 70 million gallons of water per day to the residents of Lagos and its environs. “Our team of engineers are presently working assiduously at the site to fix the leakages. “I am thanking the residents of those areas which have been affected by the water disruption for their patience, endurance, cooperation and support at this period,’’ he said. Badmus said that the corporation was expediting action to rectify the situation. He assured the public that operations soon would commence to restore regular water supply across the state. News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that many neighbourhoods in the state have been experiencing water scarcity for over two weeks.
