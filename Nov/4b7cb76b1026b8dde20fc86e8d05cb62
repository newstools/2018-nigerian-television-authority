This has put to rest the controversy surrounding the issue. The Registrar of the Council, Dr Iyi Uwadiae, made the presentation at the president’s mini conference hall at the Presidential Villa, Abuja. Uwadiae, who was accompanied by senior staff of the council, performed the ceremony during a courtesy visit to the State House. The presentation was witnessed by the Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Mr Boss Mustapha, Minister of Education, Adamu Adamu and other presidential aides. There has been controversy by the opposition parties over Buhari’s academic credentials. The president was reported to have informed the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) that his credentials were in possession of the military board. Buhari’s position had, however, continued to trigger some comments from political observers. The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) had on Oct. 26 challenged Buhari to show proof of his integrity by presenting his academic credentials “if he has any,” to the INEC. The certificate was handed over to him by the council’s register. Hinatufe Henry Solomon is a graduate of Computer Science, specialist in ICT Support Services.
