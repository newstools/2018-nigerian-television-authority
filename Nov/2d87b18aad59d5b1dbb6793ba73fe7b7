Punch should have asked what brought the Service Chiefs to the “Next Level 2019” event at the State House, only to leave before it got underway. They were mistaken in their assumption that this was a non-political event, to showcase the achievements of the administration, the success of which they are a part. Hardly were they seated than did the Minister of Defence, Brigadier General Mansur Dan AlI (Rtd) ask them to leave as this was a political gathering. They quickly left, even before the arrival of the President and for the event to get under way. The fuss over this in therefore absolutely unnecessary.
