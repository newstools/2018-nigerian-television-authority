The Presidential Committee on the North East Initiative (PCNI) has trained 400 youths in Adamawa state on Information Communication Technology ICT. According to the PCNI Vice Chairman Tijjani Tumsah, about 11,000 youths had applied for the training programme at the initial stage but only 400 succeeded after a rigorous screening. Mr. Tumsah who was represented by the PCNI State Coordinator in Adamawa State, Hamman Diram, explained that the training exercise was conducted in all six states of the region. He said the core objectives of the programme include the establishment of ICT centre of excellence in each of the six states of the North East. This is part of the PCNI’s drive to revitalize the economy of the North-East through youth empowerment and the distribution of vocational skills. The Buhari Plan, the blueprint for the recovery and rehabilitation of the region, has identified the ICT sector as one of the key priority areas for strategic investment. Diram spoke during the graduation of the students and the inauguration of ICT centre at Federal College of Education, Yola. The training in Yola followed the PCNI’s establishment of an ICT resource centre at the College of Education in Biu, Borno State three weeks ago in October.
