Obasanjo said, “Bush’s death is a loss not only to his immediate family and to the United States but also to the entire world. “With the refocused and renewed emphasis on market reforms, political and social accountability, and stronger trade relations, his legacies have continued over the years to shape  Africa’s relations with the United States.” He added,  “Bush’s special interest in Nigeria was reflective of the special relations between our two countries. “We join you and the American people in mourning the loss of a political giant, an astute administrator, a courageous leader, an erudite international statesman, and a great American hero. “Though the world would miss him, his legacies would continue to inspire many to reach the highest points of their productive, political and creative abilities.”
