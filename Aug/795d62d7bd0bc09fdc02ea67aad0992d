The Magistrate, Mrs B.O. Osunsanmi, ordered the accused to provide two sureties as part of the bail condition. Osunsami said the sureties should be gainfully employed and show evidence of two years tax payment to the Lagos State Government. The accused is facing a two-count charge of conspiracy and perversion of justice. Earlier, the Prosecutor, ASP. Ezekiel Ayorinde, told the court that the accused committed the offences with one other person still at large on June 5 at Elere Police Station, Agege, Lagos. Ayorinde said the accused obstructed and perverted the course of justice when he failed to produce his brother. “The accused stood as surety for his brother, Fatai Egbeyemi who was arrested for allegedly obtaining N2 millon under false presences, issuance of dud cheque and stealing. “Fatai was released on bail to the accused who promised to produce him whenever the police needed him until the case is finally disposed of. “Instead, he got Fatai out of custody to enable him to escape trial,’’ he said. The prosecutor said the accused was arrested to show course why the bond executed by him should not be forfeited. He said the offences contravened Sections 97 (1) and 411 of the Criminal Law of Lagos State, 2015. The accused, however, pleaded not guilty to the charge. Section 97 (1) prescribes a seven-year imprisonment for perversion of justice while Section 411 attracts two years for conspiracy. The case was adjourned until Sept. 24.
