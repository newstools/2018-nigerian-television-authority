Bashir Ahmad, Abuja: I am glad to introduce the Buhari New Media Centre (BNMC) to you. The Centre is a culmination of months of planning and strategizing on how supporters of the Muhammadu Buhari Administration can bypass the plethora of fake news, lies and negatives, to push out its achievements to Nigerians at all levels. The Buhari New Media Centre (BNMC) is a platform that houses and connects together the various followers of President Muhammadu Buhari on all social media platforms, everywhere they are in the world; providing them a hub to receive credible information on the achievements, successes and activities of the President Buhari administration. Beyond being a social media site, the BNMC platform will form a hub for supporters of the President, which will be leveraged on to hold various social media meetings and sensitization tours across the country. There will also be a ‘Project Tour’, where some members of the BNMC and some selected social media influencers will be visiting some of the places where major completed or ongoing Federal Government projects are being executed across the six geo-political zones. E.g. Sukukroad projects, railways, Mambilla Power projects, Second Niger Bridge and many more. What the BNMC stand for? Our intention is to inform, and inform correctly. Our focus is to receive, and respond appropriately. Our mantra is to tell the truth at all times. The primary target audience of the Buhari New Media Centre is Nigerians, home and in the Diaspora. And our wider target is the globe since the interest in Nigeria is beyond our borders. In the coming hours, I will be coming with more details on how all the supporters of President Muhammadu Buhari will be part of the digital initiative.
