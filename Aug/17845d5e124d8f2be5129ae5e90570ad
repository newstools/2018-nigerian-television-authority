Chelsea beat Huddersfield Town 3-0 in Maurizio Sarri’s first Premier League match as head coach.  FIFA 2018 World Cup winner N’Golo Kante opened the scoring on 34 minutes with a first-time volley from Willian’s cross. Huddersfield Town striker Steve Mounie then headed against a post before Jorginho doubled Chelsea’s lead in the last minute of the first half. The summer signing converted a penalty after Marcos Alonso had been fouled by Christopher Schindler. Eden Hazard came off the bench to assist Pedro in the second half, while new Chelsea goalkeeper Kepa Arrizabalaga earned a clean sheet on debut at John Smith’s Stadium. Roberto Pereyra scored twice as Watford opened their Premier League campaign with a comfortable 2-0 victory over Brighton and Hove Albion on Saturday. The Argentina international opened the scoring with a stunning volley, showing great composure to sweetly convert from Jose Holebas’ corner in the 35th minute. The 27-year-old Pereyra doubled the hosts’ advantage soon after the break, driving into the box before curling a neat finish into the far corner from a tight angle.
