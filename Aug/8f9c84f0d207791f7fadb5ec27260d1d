The route from Ankara has regained momentum this year. During the first seven months of 2018, authorities apprehended 14,470 people who were trying to reach European shores, especially in the Aegean Sea, with an annual increase of about 60 per cent. Since the controversi al agreement signed in March 2016 with Brussels, the number of people reaching Europe on a daily basis from Turkey had decreased significantly.
