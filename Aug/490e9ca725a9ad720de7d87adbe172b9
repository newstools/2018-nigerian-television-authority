The arrival of the body would mark the beginning of a three-day state funeral for the global statesman and Nobel peace laureate, said Deputy Minister for Information Kojo Oppong-Nkrumah to the media. Kofi Annan passed on at a hospital in Bern, Switzerland, on August 18 after a short illness. President Nana Akufo-Addo had told the family the late statesman would be buried at the new military cemetery located at the Burma Camp in the capital, Accra, with funeral expenses borne by the state. According to the minister, the body will be received by President Akufo-Addo accompanied by the wife and children of Kofi Annan, and UN officials. The general public will have the opportunity to file past the body on the following day to pay their last respects. Oppong-Nkrumah, substantive minister for information-designate, said this would be followed by a solemn memorial service after which the body would be interred at the military cemetery. According to him, several heads of state, UN officials and diplomatic delegations will join the family for the burial service. “Mr. Annan’s personal testament requested a simple, solemn final set of activities. And so the state, while it wishes to give him a befitting burial, will accommodate his wishes as well,” the deputy minister said.
