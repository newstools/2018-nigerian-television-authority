He made the announcement today on his twitter handle. According to Victor Moses, he is retiring after so much deliberations and would love to thank the country for the opportunity given to him to wear the Super Eagles shirt. In a statement on his official twitter handle, Moses admitted that he enjoyed wearing the Green and White jersey of Nigeria but he was quick to add that he would want to bow out to see the new generation take over. Moses said he has already told the Super Eagles coach Genort Rohr about his decision. He thanked the NFF and all that made his stay with the national team worthwhile. Aside helping Nigeria win the Africa Cup of Nations in 2013, Moses featured for Nigeria in two FIFA World Cups in Brazil and Russia. <img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1156" src="http://www.3ts-info.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/victor2-300x169.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="169" /> <img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1157" src="http://www.3ts-info.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/victor3-300x245.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="245" />
