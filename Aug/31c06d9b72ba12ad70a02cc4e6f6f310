He said that the troops of Sector 3 Operation SHARAN DAJI later confirmed that over 30 bandits were killed while many others were injured. Daramola said that the ATF would continue to dominate the area through armed reconnaissance and air interdiction missions to completely decimate the bandits to ensure a return to normalcy in Zamfara and other states in the Northwest. The spokesman advised all persons involved in armed banditry in the area to renounce violence, surrender to security agencies and hand over their weapons.(NAN) Innocent Korie is an ICT and Project Management Professional with very good flair in business development, and social media management.
