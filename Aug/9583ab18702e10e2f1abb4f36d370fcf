Yobe like other states in the northeast has been at the receiving end of a decade-long Islamic insurgency that has killed thousands of people and displaced millions. Olowo lauded the Yobe Government for donating four new Toyota Hilux to the command, to strengthen its operations. The commandant pledged that the command would reciprocate the government’s gesture by showing more commitment in their service delivery. He wished Yobe residents a hitch-free sallah celebration, advising them to be cautious and to report suspicious movements to security operatives. (NAN)
