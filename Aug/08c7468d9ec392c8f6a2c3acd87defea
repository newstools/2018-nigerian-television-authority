Nigeria’s Super Falcons played 1-1 with China to secure their qualification to the Quarterfinal stage of the ongoing FIFA U-20 Women’s World Cup. <img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1075" src="http://www.3ts-info.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/falcon-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /> As Nigeria lost their first match to Germany 1-0 and defeated Haiti with the same scoreline in the second match, a draw was all the Falcons needed and performed bravely to deny the Chinese team a place in the knockouts. China’s Linyan Zhang broke the deadlock in the 41st minute after numerous attempts from both sides. With China looking destined for the knockout phase, Nigeria dramatically came back into the game and found the back of the net through Rasheedat Ajibade, captain, who netted for the Falconets in the 95th minute to get a draw. Nigeria would get a place in the Semis if they can overcome Spain in the quarterfinal on Thursday, August 16.
