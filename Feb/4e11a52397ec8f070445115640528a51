Jos Electricity Distribution Company (JEDC) says it has commenced installation of the second phase of 10, 000 free-paid meters to its customers in Gombe State. Alhaji Sani Hamza, Gombe Regional Manager, told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) that the free meters were pre-loaded with 100 units of electricity at N3, 130 and 50 units for N1, 565. Jos Electricity Distribution Company “Right now, we have started en mass with Tumfure axis; we have already completed Labour Quarters. “We are now in Investment Quarters and from that side, we are coming down to the main town,” he explained. He said that the company had successfully installed over 2,000 meters to customers in the first phase of the exercise. “We want to meter every customer in all the local government areas of the state. “It is part of the regulation by Nigeria Electricity Regulation Commission, that all customers must be metered, so we are now trying to fulfill that part of the regulation,” he said. He said this would enable the customers to pay exactly what they consumed, unlike before when some customers complained of over-billing. He advised consumers against tampering with the meters after installation, adding that such act was a punishable offence. (NAN)
