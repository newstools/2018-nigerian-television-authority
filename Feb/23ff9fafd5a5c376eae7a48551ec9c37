He will be sorely missed by all of us,” Mu’azu said on Wednesday in Kafanchan. Bishop Bagobiri died in his sleep on Tuesday in Kaduna. He was aged 61. The local government boss, who reacted to his demise in an interview, said that the cleric lived a life worthy of emulation by all spiritual leaders. “He showed love to everyone irrespective of tribe or religion; he was a father to all and insisted that everyone must be treated equally. “He was always available to mediate toward building mutual confidence necessary for peaceful co-existence,” the administrator said. Mu’azu said that Bagobiri was always frank and would call a spade by its name without any fear or favour. According to him, “Bishop Bagobiri was a detribalised Nigerian, who believed in equality and justice for the poor and the vulnerable”. The administrator said that he would particularly miss Bagobiri’s sincere counsel and his usually positive disposition during crises situations, and prayed God to grant his soul eternal rest.
