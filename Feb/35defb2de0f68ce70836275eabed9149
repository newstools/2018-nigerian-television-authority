The Acting Executive Secretary of the Commission, Tony Ojukwu Esq made this call in Abuja on Monday while reacting to confirmation by the federal government that 110 out of the total of 906 students in Government Science and Technical College in Dapchi, Yobe state were unacounted for, after the school was allegedly attacked by Boko Haram insurgents on February 19, 2018.  Mr. Ojukwu who also Heads the NHRC Human Rights/Humanitarian Assessment Team in the North East condemned what happened in Dapchi as “inhuman and degrading treatment which inflicts both physical and psychological torture on the innocent school girls and an affront on their fundamental rights and freedoms ”.  The Acting Chief Executive Officer of the Commission therefore calls on security agencies to restructure the security architecture of the country and take adequate measures to protect all educational institutions in the country against any further attacks.  The Commission commiserates with the government and families of the victims of the Dapchi incident and urged that immediate steps must be taken to rescue the missing girls and prosecute the abductors.
