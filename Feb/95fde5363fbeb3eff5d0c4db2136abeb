The National Leadership of Democratic Youth Congress for PMB 2019 under the able leadership of Hon. Kassim Muhammad Kassim, Member, Nasarawa State House of Assembly has today dragged President Muhammadu Buhari to the Federal High Court, Abuja. The group did so in the quest to mandate President Buhari to accept the clarion calls coming from across the country for him to recontest come 2019 to which he is yet to decide despite the calls. Flanked by the National Legal Adviser, Hon. Barr. Abubakar Obere Kana, National Media and Publicity Chairman, Mr. Donatus Nadi Sunday and the National Director General, New Media and Special Duties, Rt. Hon. Shuaibu Sani, the group said they had no option than to call on the President to answer the clarion call of millions of Nigerians, at home and in the diaspora to continue the fight against corruption beyond 2019.
