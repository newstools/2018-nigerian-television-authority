Akinwunmi Ambode-led administration had directed that every public servant in the state must undergo the compulsory “Lagos State Structural Training Programme’’ before promotion. The training for levels 01 to 06, which commenced on Monday at the council’s headquarters with about 23 officers, will end on Tuesday. The Chairman, Surulere Local Government Council, Tajudeen Ajide, said the training was in accordance with the government’s directive. Represented at the opening by Mr Biodun Barbington, who is the Head of Administration and Human Resource Department of the council, Ajide said the process was to prepare the staff at various levels for necessary skills before promotion. “The training is a directive by the Gov. Akinwunmi Ambode’s administration that every public servant in the state must undergo a Structural Training Programme. “It is to replace the written test for public officers in Lagos State as part of the conditions for their promotion. “This training is only for those who are eligible officers for the 2018 promotion; this is the first part that has to do with training, while the second part will come up in April 11. “The second phase of the training which involves oral interview will be conducted during the Junior Staff Management Committee meeting to consider those that are eligible for promotion,’’ he said. The chairman said the outcome of the first and second trainings would determine the actual number of officers that would be promoted to the next grade levels. Ajide advised the officers to support the government by being dedicated to their duties. NAN reports that the training is a yearly programme which started in 2017, to further enhance and nurture officers for a better experience and service delivery. (NAN)
