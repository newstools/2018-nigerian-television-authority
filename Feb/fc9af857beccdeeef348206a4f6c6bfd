Controversy came easy to her, be it her rivalry with Jaya Prada, Madhuri Dixit or Rekha, her alleged relationship with Mithun Chakraborty or her sudden marriage with Boney Kapoor, who was already married with children. But her personal choices never stopped her fans for caring for her. Sri-Jeetendra pair became one of the most successful pairs ever in Hindi films, what with hits like Jaani Dost (1983), Justice Chaudhury (1983), Balidaan (1985) to their credit. They went on to star in almost twenty films together in a six year period. Their films became known for their pots and pans choreography and overflowing melodrama but were a rage nevertheless. The other actor who she formed a fevicol bond was with Anil Kapoor. The duo appeared in around fourteen films together, most of them successful. <img src="http://www.nta.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Screenshot_2018-02-25-07-16-06-1-420x376.png" alt="" width="420" height="376" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-58922" srcset="http://www.nta.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Screenshot_2018-02-25-07-16-06-1-420x376.png 420w, http://www.nta.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Screenshot_2018-02-25-07-16-06-1-150x134.png 150w, http://www.nta.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Screenshot_2018-02-25-07-16-06-1-768x688.png 768w, http://www.nta.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Screenshot_2018-02-25-07-16-06-1-720x645.png 720w, http://www.nta.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Screenshot_2018-02-25-07-16-06-1.png 800w" sizes="(max-width: 420px) 100vw, 420px" /> The actress was in the pink of health and was looking forward to daughter Janhvi’s much anticipated debut in Dhadak. She had apparently gone to Dubai to attend Mohit Marwah’s wedding and suffered a massive heart attack from which she never recovered. She’s survived by daughter Janhvi and Khushi and husband Boney Kapoor. Source: Filmfare A.M Tanimu is an Online Editor with Africa's Largest TV Network.
