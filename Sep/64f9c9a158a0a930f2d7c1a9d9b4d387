Alli, however, urged Nigerians to separate statutory duties and functions from politics. He noted that payment of taxes is a statutory and moral duty; which is the civic responsibility of all citizens. “There is no relationship between tax payment and politics as far as we are concerned and we do the needful whoever is involved we make sure they pay,” he said.
