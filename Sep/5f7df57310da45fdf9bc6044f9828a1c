Femi Adesina, Abuja: It was a day of glory for President Muhammadu Buhari as the State of New Jersey and City of Philadelphia gave him special citations in New York on Friday. The President had made a presentation at the High Level Roundtable on Corruption, Migration and Bridging Africaâ€™s Infrastructure Gap, a programme on the margins of the 73rd United Nations General Assembly. And then stepped forward, Diane Campbell, representing Senator Turner of New Jersey, who read a citation of the Nigerian leader, acknowledging his military, professional and political strides. President Buhari stood ramrod straight, as the hall erupted in rapturous applause. The Chairman, Nigerian Coalition for Business Development and Investment, Dr Jude Iheoma, also read a citation on behalf of the City of Philadelphia. On hand to witness the honour were international investors and captains of industry. Also there were ministers; directors-general; Dr Ibrahim Mayaki, CEO NEPAD International; Princess Gloria Akobundu, CEO NEPAD Nigeria; Prof Ibrahim Gambari, former Minister of External Affairs; and top senior government officials from Nigeria.
