There is need to review and peg the quantity of fuel tankers and weight of cargoes trailers plying our roads should carry. “I also understand that the yet to be found under age driver of the tanker lost control of it and ran into people’s property killing two people and injuring seven. This has further underscore the need for a law to penalise owners of vehicles driven by these kid drivers”. The governor then directed the Chairman, Suleja Local Government Council, Hon.
