They used machetes to kill their victims who were working on their farms So far, we have recovered 12 dead bodies from the fields and nearby bush.‚Äù Three people were injured in the raids. The militants had guns but did not use them so as not to attract the attention of troops in nearby Molai village. Boko Haram has stepped up attacks on farmers and loggers in recent years, accusing them of passing information on the group to the military.
