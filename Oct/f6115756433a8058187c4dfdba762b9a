Some other suspicious packages were also addressed to former Director of Central Intelligence Agency, Mr John Brennan, Democratic Representative Maxine Waters and former Attorney General Eric Holder, among others. The Federal Bureau of Investigation said the suspicious packages were received at multiple locations in the New York, Washington, D.C., areas and Florida. President Donald Trump had tweeted: “The safety of the American People is my highest priority. I have just concluded a briefing with the FBI, Department of Justice, Department of Homeland Security, and the U.S. Secret Service…” Earlier, while condemning the incident, Trump said “acts or threats of political violence of any kind have no place in the United States of America”. Trump said: “The full weight of our government is being deployed to conduct this investigation and bring those responsible for these despicable acts to justice. “This egregious conduct is abhorrent to everything we hold dear and sacred as Americans. We will spare no resources or expense in this effort”. White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders later said in a statement: “We condemn the attempted violent attacks recently made against President Obama, President Clinton, Secretary Clinton, and other public figures”. First Lady Melania Trump also condemned the incident saying “we cannot tolerate those cowardly attacks and I strongly condemn all who choose violence”. In her reaction, Mrs Clinton said: “We are fine, thanks to the men and women of the Secret Service who intercepted the package addressed to us long before it made its way to our home. “It is a troubling time isn’t it? And it’s a time of deep divisions and we have to do everything we can to bring our country together”. CNN Worldwide President Jeff Zucker, however, expressed dissatisfaction with the president’s and White House’s comments. Zucker said: “There is a total and complete lack of understanding at the White House about the seriousness of their continued attacks on the media. “The President, and especially the White House Press Secretary, should understand their words matter. Thus far, they have shown no comprehension of that”. In a joint statement, House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi and Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said the president’s remarks on Wednesday fell short. “We all take an oath to support and defend the constitution and protect the American people, and that is our first responsibility. “However, President Trump’s words ring hollow until he reverses his statements that condone acts of violence,” they said. New York Mayor Bill de Blasio also said the incident was “clearly an act of terrorism”. Hinatufe Henry Solomon is a graduate of Computer Science, specialist in ICT Support Services.
