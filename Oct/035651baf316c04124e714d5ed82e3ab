Atiku Bagudu of Kebbi State has renewed his commitment and support to ensure cancer treatment be included into the National Health Insurance Scheme to reduce high cost of cancer treatment in Nigeria. The Governor made this known during the advocacy campaign tagged `Walk Away Cancer’ organised by Medicaid Cancer Foundation on Saturday in Abuja. Bagudu said he would support whatever is possible to reverse the rising cases of cancer in the country. “What I also advocate is that we should be more active in setting up more treatment centres that will be competing with each other so that cost of cancer treatment will continue to come down,’’ he said. He specifically appealed to doctors and young scientists to pick interest in treatment of cancer so that they push for more changes in life style to further prevent the deadly disease. He noted that the advocacy programme was a significant annual event initiated by Dr Zainab Bagudu, his wfe, through her foundation. According to him, the foundation support many people from all works of life to be more aware of the cancer challenges and mobilise support for the people who unfortunately are living with the disease. Earlier, MRS Bagudu, also founder Medicaid Cancer Foundation, said the five kilometre walk was to increase cancer awareness and promote better chances of survival from the disease. She added that the motive of the walk was to encourage people to imbibe the culture of exercise, stressing that “we want to get free from cancer, we want walk away from cancer’’. Top government functionaries, wives of governors, personalities from the entertainment industries and international footballers participated in the five kilometer walk.
