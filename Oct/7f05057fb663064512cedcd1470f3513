He was a consummate political strategist and will be sorely missed,” Lalong said in a statement on Monday in Jos. Lalong said that Anenih’s death had robbed the country of a patriot and created a vacuum that would be difficult to fill. The governor commiserated with his Edo counterpart, Mr Godwin Obaseki, the people of the state, and the family of Anenih over the retired Police Commissioner’s exit, urging them to be consoled by the fact that he lived a fulfilled life. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN), reports that Anenih, former National Chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), died in Abuja on Sunday. He was aged 85.
