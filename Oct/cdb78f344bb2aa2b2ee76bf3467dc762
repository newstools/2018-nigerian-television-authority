Leah Sharibu is the only Christian among the abducted 119 students of Government Girls Secondary School, Dapchi, Yobe, still in Boko Haram captivity. Malam Garba Shehu, the President’s Senior Special Assistant on Media and Publicity, confirmed the telephone conversation between the president and Sharibu. He said the President consoled the Sharibu family and assured the parents that the Federal Government would do its utmost for the safety and security of their daughter. “I convey my emotion, the strong commitment of my administration and the solidarity of all Nigerians to you and your family as we will do our best to bring your daughter home in peace and safety,” Buhari told her. He assured the mother that his heart was with her family, as that of the entire nation which continues to pray for the safe return of “our daughter, Leah’’. The captors of Leah were reported to have issued Oct. 15 as deadline for the Federal Government to meet their demands on the release of Leah or they would kill her.
