Mrs Nnenna Akajemeli, Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of SERVICOM, made the assertion a keynote address presented at the 5th Stakeholders Forum of the Federal Airport Authority of Nigeria (FAAN) on Monday in Port Harcourt. Akajemeli, represented by Mrs Stella Benson, a SERVICOM officer, assured Nigerians of SERVICOM’s readiness to pursue values aimed at ensuring world class services across Nigerian MDAs, including the airports. She therefore, charged airport staff, especially the Customer Service Department across Nigerian airports to rise up to the challenge of repositioning services inline with world class standard. “As foot soldiers of service delivery in your departments, you should therefore, not relent in adopting and implementing service standards, principles and core values that will drive service delivery processes,” she said. Commending the current leadership of the Customer Service Department of FAAN led by Mrs Ebele Okoye, Akajemeli said Okoye’s leadership initiatives had led to a more rewarding staff/customer relationship and improved services. In the same vain, Mr Saleh Dunoma, Managing Director, FAAN, represented by the South-South/South-East Regional Manager, Mr Afolabi Ojo, thanked SERVICOM for their initiative and promised to sustain achievements of the customer Service Department. He said that the stakeholders forum has created an opportunity for FAAN to evaluate, analyze and improve on services to air travelers as well as other airport users. On her part, Okoye, thanked the participants, adding that the forum had availed FAAN the opportunity to know their challenges in terms of service delivery and had helped the it proffer ways for improvements. “The aim of this forum is actually to get relevant stakeholders together to chart the way forward and to achieve better service delivery system and the bottom line is that we now have improved services,” she said. Okoye promised that the initiative would be sustained as they were poised to ensure world class services across our airports.
