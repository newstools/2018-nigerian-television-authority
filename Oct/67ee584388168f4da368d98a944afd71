The Convention Committee said this was done to afford delegates from states that are just concluding their primaries, time to participate in the event. “All delegates from outside Abuja are to get accredited at the National Stadium, while delegates within Abuja will be accredited at the old parade ground. Convention committee regrets inconveniences.” The Committee added. Hinatufe Henry Solomon is a graduate of Computer Science, specialist in ICT Support Services.
