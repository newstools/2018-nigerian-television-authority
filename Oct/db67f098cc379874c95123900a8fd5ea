Mrs Deborah Whyte, the Leader of the group, said cervical cancer is one of the leading causes of death among women in the country. She said there is every need for women to go for early screening and detection. “You may never know even if it is there, until you undergo screening. “Most times you don’t feel anything, but when you begin to feel something, it means it is already in a bad stage. “This is why early screening is very important and if there are changes in the cervix it can be treated,” she said. As at the time of the report, about 63 women were screened and none was detected. Mrs Kate Onyibo, a beneficiary, commended the organisers, saying it is timely. She said “most women don’t know the importance of this screening. My pastor last week announced in the church about the cervical screening and encouraged all women to participate. “We are only two that attended.” Madam Cecilia Olutoyi, another participant said most of the women are ashamed and others feel men are the ones handling the screening that was why they did not attend. “I was screened and the result was ready for collection immediately,” she said.
