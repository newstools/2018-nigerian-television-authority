Mr Ayan Ogbe, Director of Promotions of the agency, said in a statement on Wednesday in Lagos. According to Ogbe, the project called, “Energising Economies Initiative (EEI),” is a Federal Government initiative to boost Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs). He said that the initiative, which would be built across the country, was part of the government’s effort to ease power shortage to over 200,000 MSMEs. Ogbe said that over 799 generators would have been decommissioned, thereby reducing harmful greenhouse emissions and noise pollution when the project was completed. He said that besides, the initiative would create over 2,500 jobs and reduce carbon emissions by 25,000 metric tonnes annually. “Sura Shopping Complex, an ultra-modern complex located in Lagos, has over 11 different businesses. “It ranges from printing, branding, financial services, equipment maintenance, catering to tailoring services. “The complex has 1,047 shops which had been metered,” he said. Ogbe said that the project was built and managed by a private sector developer, Solad Holdings Ltd., Lagos.
