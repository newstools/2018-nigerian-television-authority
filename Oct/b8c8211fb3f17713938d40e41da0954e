We had earlier conducted the second stage which is the screening. “Efforts are on now to call people that have been shortlisted for the officers and marshal inspectorate cadres,” he said. According to him, those applicants shortlisted during the screening will be made to write an exam which is to be conducted by JAMB. “The marshal assistants which is the lowest cadre, including artisans, will only be interviewed without going through the JAMB exam. “After JAMB, the officers will still go through the interview but the marshal assistants are going for an interview which is going to be their last stage. “They will soon be contacted,” he said.
