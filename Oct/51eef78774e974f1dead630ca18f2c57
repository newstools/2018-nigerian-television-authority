The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the NCCIMA promised to explore the potential in solid minerals sector for successful integration and diversification of the economy. The Director-General, NCCIMA, Mr Adamu Sale, made this known in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on Tuesday in Abuja. Sale said that the workshop would be taking place at Legbo Kutigi International Conference Centre, Minna. He said that the forum would attract participants from the 19 states in the North, the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), and the respective chambers of commerce. He explained that the forum would showcase the products and services in Nigeria’s solid minerals sector as a catalyst for diversifying the nation’s economy. “As the national economy grapples with the exigencies of volatility in global economic fortunes, it has become a notorious fact that the government must embrace diversification and aggressively elevate both agriculture and solid minerals sectors. “These two sectors, no doubt, hold great potentials for job creation, wealth generation and the quest for a resilient economy. “Indeed, the Federal Government, while launching the Economic Recovery and Growth Plan (ERGP), had envisioned a new Nigeria transformed from a consuming nation to a producing nation; from an import dependent nation to an export-oriented nation; from a nation that survives on one commodity to a nation that runs on multiple engines of growth. “In the last three years, the Federal Government through the ministry of mines and steel development has striven to evolve adequate regulatory frameworks and investment friendly policies. “It is imperative that states and local governments pick up the gauntlet, exploring avenues to create jobs and enhance wealth through the creation of special purpose vehicles or engage in joint ventures in exploiting the vast mineral deposits in their domain,” he said. According to him, the second edition is also expected to draw the attentions of relevant stakeholders to the available opportunities in the sector. The director-general said that the key objective is to explore alternative sources of revenue for the states, create job opportunities through value addition and capacity building or prospective miners, processors, investors and sundry stakeholders. Sale said that the forum would create awareness on the best practices, application of technology and inherent environmental hazards, saying that it would also promote local and foreign investment in the Nigerian mining industry. He explained that the forum would encourage innovative service and practices in the industry in accordance with international best practices and trends. According to him, discussants in the thematic areas, who are carefully drawn from the academia, government and experienced industry players, would lead participants to explore legal and regulatory frameworks, collaboration among three tiers of government, management, environment and finance. “Discussion will also touch on technology equipment and geological studies to determine quantity and quality issues related to the sector. “It would also serve as avenue to energise states and local governments to organise and register artisanal miners operating in their domain to ensure safer mining environment and improved revenue; curb environmental degradation and unhealthy practices that characterise illegal mining in many local communities’ activities,” he said. Sale, however, said that the forum would also be a rallying point for states and local governments to come up with templates to monitor, guide and support miners for optimal job creation and revenue enhancement. “In addition, it would provide opportunities for miners to learn the benefits of cooperatives, safer mining processes, equipment leasing and financial support from sundry government agencies for improved productivity and profitability. “They will learn, first-hand, the operation of government’s minerals buying centres across the country to ensure that minerals are properly priced and sold in a structured market setting as opposed to underground sales that had robbed both the local miners and the country of the expected financial gains,” he explained. NAN reports that the first Northern Nigeria Solid Minerals Fair and Workshop was organised by the Kaduna Chamber of Commerce, Industry, Mines and Agriculture (KADCCIMA), brought voices to the table on how to revamp the ailing solid minerals sector in Nigeria. The forum drew experts from the northern region together to brainstorm on how to explore the nation’s solid minerals for successful integration to diversify the economy away from over-dependence on oil revenue.(NAN) Suleiman idris is a graduate of Fed Univ of Tech Minna (BTECH Mathematics/Comp Science), Specialist in ICT Support Services. also proficient in use of online journalism tools & Social media management.
