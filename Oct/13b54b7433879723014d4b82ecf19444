Mr Russel Brooks, Public Relations Officer, United States Consulate General, gave the advice during the 2018 Lagos Photo Festival. The festival took place at African Artists’ Foundation at Victoria Island, Lagos. He said that partaking in photography could help in boosting the country’s image to the international community. “Photography is very essential in our daily activities and Nigerians must explore the importance of this as the world had evolved. “By showcasing the various cultures and unique things that the country has, it would help in boosting its image and showcasing the unique culture of the country. “Nigerians must take advantage of this because photography is a vital part of the world and they must partake in it,’’ Brooks said. He said that the festival would help foster better understanding between the U. S. and Nigeria. “The festival would help to boost the understanding between both countries and human capital must be shared. “One of the way of doing that is through this photo festival. “Also, the festival would show the unique beauty of this country and to give Nigerians the opportunity to see the essence of photography, ‘’ Brooks said. He said that the U.S. would also initiate programmes that would help the people in the country. Mr Azu Nwagbogu, Director, African Artists Foundation, said that photography was a time capsule that could stand the test of time. “Photos capture the moment and ensure that that moment is cherished for a lifetime; so taking photos is really important. “The festival is to display the various places and landscapes of the country and to show the world that Nigeria has unique places. “It would also help to dispel some of the negativity that is attached to the country,’’ Nwagbogu said. Mrs Roselyn Thomas, a Tourist from the U.S., told NAN that Nigerians had great talents. “Nigerians are great people with great talents and all these photo exhibitions just go to show that. “I’m amazed with what I’m seeing today.
