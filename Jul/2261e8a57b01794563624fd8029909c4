At 0837 GMT, commercial banks quoted the shilling at 100.80/101.00 per dollar, little changed from Friday’s close of 100.85/101.05. Speed guides for the transactions include: Shilling spot rates, shilling forward rates, cross rates, local contributors, Central Bank of Kenya Index, and Kenyan Bonds contributor pages. Others are treasury bill yields, central bank open market operations, horizontal repo transactions, daily interbank lending rate, Kenya Bond pricing, and real-time Africa economic data.
