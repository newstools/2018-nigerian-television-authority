Segun Adeyemi, Abuja: Against the backdrop of the recent events at the National Assembly, I want to most sincerely thank all APC members and supporters in Kwara State for their unflinching commitment to ensuring that the party emerges stronger than ever in the state That commitment has been reflected in the overwhelming support and solidarity that we have received, not just from our party members but also from other parties and stakeholders across the state, since the melodrama at the National Assembly on Tuesday. In particular, there has been an expression of overwhelming love and support for President Muhammadu Buhari from across Kwara, in the wake of the defections by federal legislators from Kwara, Lai Mohammed said, “I call on all our members and supporters in Kwara to remain calm because there is no cause for alarm.” We are currently consulting with the national leadership of our great party, with a view to coming up with a programme of action that will take into consideration the recent developments. Our members and supporters should have no doubt whatsoever that whatever decisions we take after the consultations will be in their overall best interest A.M Tanimu is an Online Editor with Africa's Largest TV Network.
