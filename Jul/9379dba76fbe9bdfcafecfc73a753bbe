Mr Ndu Ughamadu, NNPC’s spokesman, on Wednesday in Abuja, said to achieve this the corporation would deliver about 3.4 billion standard cubic feet of gas per day (scf/d) to bridge the supply gap by 2020. The Group Managing Director of the NNPC, Dr Maikanti Baru, explained that the projects would also signal the beginning of the process of closing demand-supply gap in the domestic gas market. According to him, the project tagged `7CGDP’ is part of the gas development strategy designed by NNPC to leverage the full potential of gas to meet the target of generating at least 15GWs of electricity by 2020. Baru said the corporation had engaged two World-class management consultants – DeltaAfrik/Worley Parson and Crestech/Penspen – to work with NPDC and its Joint Venture partners and other stakeholders to achieve set project deliverables. Baru explained that the NNPC Project Management groups would strengthen oversight function on the seven critical gas development projects by ensuring prompt decision making and timely approvals in line with international best practices. He said the corporation was working closely with other agencies like the Department of Petroleum Resources (DPR) and the Nigerian Content Monitoring and Development Board (NCMDB), among others, to ensure timely approvals for the project. Mr Osagie Okunbor, Managing Director of Shell Petroleum Development Company (SPDC) which is handling three out of the seven projects, pledged the commitment of the company to the successful execution of the 7CGDP, said a statement by the corporation.
