Dr Halima Muqadas, the Chief Executive Director and Founder of the NGO, made the promise on Monday when the organisation visited the state Ministry of Women Affairs and Ministry of Health. Muqadas said that the initiative was designed to reduce the rampant cases of stunted growth in children. She said that the state ranked among states of the federation with high statistics on stunted growth in children. She said that mothers required first hand knowledge that could help them to identify the phenomenon and ensure timely visit to health facilities for treatment. She said that the NGO had articulated some health programmes, which would commence soon in the state. Muqadas said: “Already, we have lined up 2018 programmes, comprising educating mothers on identifying acute malnutrition in children before accessing healthcare and exclusive breastfeeding. “Others are sanitation, hygiene, women empowerment and adult education.” She further said that the NGO would partner the Ministry for Women Affairs in identifying participants to be trained and mentored on different skills. Responding, the state Commissioner for Women Affairs and Child Development, Mrs Rukaiya Kewa, underscored the benefits of skills acquisition among women. Kewa said that training women in different skills would help to equip them to become self-reliant and managers of their businesses. “The Bauchi state government has trained many women in various trades. “We are exploring ways to add value to their products to make them competitive in the market,’’ she said. Also speaking, the state Commissioner for Health, Dr Zuwaira Hassan, commended the NGO for its health initiatives aimed at complementing the health agenda of the present administration. She assured the group of the ministry’s support and collaboration to ensure that the sate became disease-free.
